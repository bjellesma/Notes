**Exercise 1**

This wasn't as difficult as the other exercises because the timing was only eight forth notes and a whole note and only three frets were used. It's certainly easier and faster to use the guitar tabs rather than the sheet music. Being able to read sheet music is a benefit because it's more universal between instruments. I was able to play in even time, accurately, and clearly.

**Exercise 2**

This exercise was a little more difficult because it added one more fret into the mix. The timing structure still wasn't very difficult but because the notes were played on neither the first nor sixth string, it took a little extra effort to make the notes accurately. As before, I tried to read the sheet music, but found it much easier and faster to use the tabs. Overall, I was still able to play in even time, accurately, and clearly but it simply took a little extra effort.

**Exercise 3**

This exercise was on par with exercise 2 in terms of difficulty. It was only the three frets but it had a lot more switching of frets which takes practice to do.

**Exercise 4**

This was really a tougher one to practice. For one, the time structure is slightly different; it is still not very difficult, but different. The really tough part was the fact that 5 of six strings are used. This brought the accuracy down for me and required me to really slow down and sometimes fall out of time.
