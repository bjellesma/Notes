Scales are sometimes played at different positions. The positions basically mean playing at different frets. Here's a summery of the positions

The name of each position is determined by the fret location of the index finger. As you begin to move up the fretboard while playing in other positions, you will be playing the same notes in different frets and on different strings . In first position, for instance, your first finger assumes the role of the nut and is assigned to playing notes in the first fret. Your second finger plays notes in the second fret, your third finger plays notes in the third fret, and your fourth finger plays notes in the fourth fret. All open strings are fretted.

When you play in second position, you shift your fretting hand up one fret so that your first finger plays notes in the second fret, your second finger plays notes in the third fret, your third finger plays notes in the fourth fret, and your fourth finger plays notes in the fifth fret.

If you are playing in seventh position, your first finger plays notes in the seventh fret, your second finger plays notes in the eighth fret, your third finger plays notes in the ninth fret, and your fourth finger plays notes in the tenth fret. You get the picture.

**Chromatic Scale** - Go up and down the fretboard on the first four frets ![https://s3.amazonaws.com/musicindustryhowtoimages/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12072130/chromatic-scale-3.jpg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/musicindustryhowtoimages/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12072130/chromatic-scale-3.jpg)

When they say chromatic scale in G, they mean start on a G note and either ascend or descend the musical alphabet in that position. Because not all notes have sharps, this means that some frets may be skipped.

**Major Scales** A diatonic scale having half steps between the third and fourth and the seventh and eighth degrees and whole steps between the other adjacent degrees. major scale. So, a major scale always follows the same step pattern: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half (WWHWWWH). This pattern will always bring the root note up an octave. 

So if you were on the low E string, you'd do 1-3-5-6-8-10-12-13

Let's take this a step further an do the C Major scale in first position. Remember, first position means that your index is assigned to the first fret, middle to second fret, ring to third, and pinky to forth. Start on C on the fifth string and work your way to lower strings using a major scale pattern.
