You're able to tune a guitar by tuning a string to have the same note as the note on the string above.
Ex: the fifth fret of the Low E string is an A note which is the same as the open chord of the A string. It's not always the fifth fret because for example, the forth fret on the G string is a B note, which is the open of the next string. You can use a tuning fork, or a piano to get your starting note. Although it's useful to know how to tune by matching notes, it's better to just use a digital tuner nowadays.

You can tune the guitar by listening to the harmonics. The harmonics exist on the fifth fret, seventh fret, and twelveth fret, and divide the length of the string in forth, third, and half respectively.
