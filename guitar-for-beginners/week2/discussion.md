# Picking Technique

Did you play the picking exercises in even time, accurately, and clearly?

Using a metronome with picking makes it more difficult to keep the rythem. Playing accurately and clearly isn't much of an issue because I've played guitar previously just as a hobby. However, I've never really worked on keeping time because I would mostly just play alone as a kind of way to unwind after work.

# Finger Picking

Did you play the picking exercises in even time, accurately, and clearly?

Finger Picking is a little more difficult then using a pick because your thumb is in charge of three strings. Adding this onto the fact that I'm using a metronome, and it can be the most difficult one. Luckily, the type of music that I like is usually played on an electric guitar and I don't usually see finger picking on an electric guitar. My guess would be because the pick gives it a louder sound since you can transfer more force to the string and the music associated with an electric guitar is normally associated with that louder sound.

# Strumming Technique

Did you play the picking exercises in even time, accurately, and clearly?

This isn't as difficult as the finger picking or picking technique in my opinion because you can now use more of a blanket approach to striking the strings baring the fact that some chords and ecspecially power chords want you to leave out some chords. That said, this still involves using a metronome, so the problem of timing still exists.

# Conclusion

Although the timing is usually an issue for me to track, this is eye opening as something that I should add to my normal practicing routine.
