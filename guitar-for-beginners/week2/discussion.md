Did you play the picking exercises in even time, accurately, and clearly?

Using a metronome with picking makes it more difficult to keep the rythem. Playing accurately and clearly isn't much of an issue because I've played guitar previously just as a hobby. However, I've never really worked on keeping time because I would mostly just play alone as a kind of way to unwind after work.
