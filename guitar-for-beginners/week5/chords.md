a **Major Triad Chord** is formed by playing the first, third, and fifth note of a major scale.

There are three ways to play a Major Triad Chord:

**Root postion** - A chord is in root position if its root is the lowest note

In the **first inversion**, the lowest note is the third of the triad. In the **second inversion**, the lowest note is the fifth of the triad.

For example, playing a C Major triad chord, we use C E and G. That is, we use our ring finger on the fifth string third fret (C), middle finger on fourth string second fret (E) and play an open third string (G).

A C Major Chord typically has your index finger playing the second string first fret (C) and open first string (E). This is just doubling the notes in a different octave and gives the chord a richer sound.

A **Minor Triad Chord** is similar to a major triad chord except that the third note is down a half step. This gives the chord a more morose sound as opposed to the major chord triad which is a happier sound.

For example, a C major chord would look like this

And a C minor chord would look like this

**Bar Chords** involve barring a whole fret on every string. The F major chord involves barring the first fret on all six strings. The F Major chord follows the same pattern as other major triad chords but because of its unique pattern, the first fret is hit on the sixth, second, and first strings. Because the fifth, forth, and third strings require us to fret the third, third, and second frets respectively, we can simply bar the entire first fret.

You can also take this idea of bar chords to take open chords along the fretboard.

**Power Chords** are simply the root and fifth of a chord being played. Because the root is always in the chord. The power chord is always named after the root. 

For example, this is the basic F Major power chord

We can also double on the octave of the F major power chord for a different voicing.
