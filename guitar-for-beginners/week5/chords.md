a **Major Triad Chord** is formed by playing the first, third, and fifth note of a major scale.

There are three ways to play a Major Triad Chord:

**Root postion** - A chord is in root position if its root is the lowest note

In the **first inversion**, the lowest note is the third of the triad. In the **second inversion**, the lowest note is the fifth of the triad.

For example, playing a C Major triad chord, we use C E and G. That is, we use our ring finger on the fifth string third fret (C), middle finger on fourth string second fret (E) and play an open third string (G).

A C Major Chord typically has your index finger playing the second string first fret (C) and open first string (E). This is just doubling the notes in a different octave and gives the chord a richer sound.

A **Minor Triad Chord** is similar to a major triad chord except that the third note is down a half step. This gives the chord a more morose sound as opposed to the major chord triad which is a happier sound.

For example, a C major chord would look like this

And a C minor chord would look like this
