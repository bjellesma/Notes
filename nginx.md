nginx is a free open source web server that linux users can use to host a website. It's an alternative to an Apache web server, which can be difficult and cumbersome to set up.

# Install

```shell
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

# Configure

```shell 
mkdir /var/www/web.site
#create copy of config file
sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/site-available/web.site/config
```

Change this config file to the following:

```
# Default server configuration
#
server {
	listen 80 default_server;
	listen [::]:80 default_server;

	# SSL configuration
	#
	# listen 443 ssl default_server;
	# listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
	#
	# Note: You should disable gzip for SSL traffic.
	# See: https://bugs.debian.org/773332
	#
	# Read up on ssl_ciphers to ensure a secure configuration.
	# See: https://bugs.debian.org/765782
	#
	# Self signed certs generated by the ssl-cert package
	# Don't use them in a production server!
	#
	# include snippets/snakeoil.conf;

	root /var/www/web.site;

	# Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
	index index.html

	server_name _;

	location / {
		# First attempt to serve request as file, then
		# as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
		try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
	}

	# pass PHP scripts to FastCGI server
	#
	#location ~ \.php$ {
	#	include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
	#
	#	# With php-fpm (or other unix sockets):
	#	fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
	#	# With php-cgi (or other tcp sockets):
	#	fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
	#}

	# deny access to .htaccess files, if Apache's document root
	# concurs with nginx's one
	#
	#location ~ /\.ht {
	#	deny all;
	#}
}


# Virtual Host configuration for example.com
#
# You can move that to a different file under sites-available/ and symlink that
# to sites-enabled/ to enable it.
#
#server {
#	listen 80;
#	listen [::]:80;
#
#	server_name example.com;
#
#	root /var/www/example.com;
#	index index.html;
#
#	location / {
#		try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
#	}
#}
```

Create a link to the site in the sites-enabled directory

```shell
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/web.site /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

Rmove default size in sites enabled

```shell
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enables/default
```
