Kubernetes is an open source project by Google and is often shortened to **K8s** (the 8 stands for the 8 letters in between the k and s)

Kubernetes is like a data center OS where you give Kubernetes your app and it will run. Kubernetes will decide what it needs.

Kubernetes will organize all of the microservices (pods) into nodes which can be made up of multiple pods. These nodes are led by masters
