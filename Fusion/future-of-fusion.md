# Fusion Technology

* Stellarators and Tokamaks use nearly identical technology which is why the author is focusing on tokamaks
* a 4 Tesla field is about 1000x a fridge magnet and a little stronger than a field generated by an MRI
* The big problem is that the torrodial field coils need a large amount of electricity to generate the magnetic field necessary and copper has a lot of resisivity so the electrons bump into the atoms of the container.
