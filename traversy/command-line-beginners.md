The **Shell** is the program that the terminal runs on. **Bash** in the default on most linux systems and it was the default for a long time on Mac until they switched to **zsh**

To rename files and folders, use the **mv** command. Even though this is the move command, this will take the file and "move" it to the new name. For example, to rename a file or folder called source to src, you would do `mv source src`

The **cat** command can be used to view the contents of a file as well as write to the file. To view the contents of a file, we'd do `cat info.txt`. To write to a file, we could do `cat > info.txt` to drop us into an editor. However, we'll likely use **nano** to quickly edit from the command line.

**nano** can show linenumbers of a file by using the `-l` switch like `nano -l readme.txt`![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7660667/194983299-63448daf-eddb-4348-b342-ba4dacffd30b.png)
