## Intro

1 Liter is equal to 1 cubic decimeter

The seven base **SI** units

| Measurement | Unit | Abbreviation |
|---|---|---|
| Distance | metre (meter) | m |
| Mass | kilogram | kg |
| Time | second | s |
| Temperature | kelvin | K |
| Current | amphere | A |
| Quantity | mole | mol |
| Luminous Intensity | candela | cd |

Many other units you hear about such as the newton (N) and the joule (J) are derived from these base units. Units are never pluralized to avoid ambiguity. Foe example, 30 min is correct while 30 mins is incorrect. Units are also always written with a space between the value and the unit and between each part of a compound unit. For instance, meter per second is written as $m{ }s^{-1}$ where as millisecond is written as $ms$
