Examples of supervised machine learning would be taking an input such as email and expecting an output such as whether it's spam. This is an application called **spam filtering**. Other examples are found below.

| input | Output | Application |
| ----- | ------ | ------------|
| audio | transcripts | speech recognition |
| english | spanish | machine translation |
| ad | will the user click based on profile | online advertising |
| image, radar | position of other cars | self driving |
| image of item | detection of defect (0/1) | visual inspection |

One more concretely visual example would be predicting the cost of a house based on the square footage. You can use a straight line to try to fit in the data or use a slightly complex more curved line. An ML algorithm may tell you the best method to use. This is supervised ML because we gave the algorithm the correct price or labels for the data.
