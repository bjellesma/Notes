A deep neural network simply has many hidden layers and can be better at processing data depending on the task. This is in contrast to something like logistic regression where it can be referred to as a **shallow neural network**. Technically, a shallow neural network will have at least one hidden layer whereas logistic regression has no hidden layers and can be thought of as a **minimal neural network**
