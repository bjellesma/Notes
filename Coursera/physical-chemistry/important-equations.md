* $\Delta U = q_{in} + w_{on}$
* $w_{on} = - p \Delta V$
* $\Delta U = q_v$ where $q_v$ where heat generated occurs under constant volume or isochoric conditions
* $\Delta H = q_p$ where $q_p$ is heat generated under isobaric conditions
* $w_{on} = - nRT \ln \frac{V_f}{V_i}$ is Work for reversible isothermal expansion
* $C=q / \Delta T$ Heat Capacity of an object
* $C_v = q_v / \Delta T = \Delta U / \Delta T$ Isochoric heat capacity
* $C_p = q_p / \Delta T = \Delta H / \Delta T$ Isobaric heat capacity
* $C_{p,m} = C_{V,m} + R$ Specific and molar heat capacity for an ideal gas
