* $K = C + 273.15$ converting celsius to Kelvin
* $\Delta U = q_{in} + w_{on}$ is the first law of thermodynamics
* $w_{on} = - p \Delta V$ is work done on an expanding gas by irreversible expansion
* $pV=nRT$ is the ideal gas equation
* $\Delta U = q_v$ where $q_v$ where heat generated occurs under constant volume or isochoric conditions
* $\Delta H = q_p$ where $q_p$ is heat generated under isobaric conditions
* $w_{on} = - nRT \ln \frac{V_f}{V_i}$ is Work for reversible isothermal expansion
* $C=q / \Delta T$ Heat Capacity of an object
* $C_v = q_v / \Delta T = \Delta U / \Delta T$ Isochoric heat capacity
* $C_p = q_p / \Delta T = \Delta H / \Delta T$ Isobaric heat capacity
* $Q=mc \Delta T$ where Q is energy, m is mass, c is specific heat capactity, and \Delta T is change is temperature
* $\Delta H = n C \Delta T$ where $\delta H$ is the change in enthalpy
* $C_s = \frac{C}{m}$ is the specific heat capacity
* $C_m = \frac{C}{n}$ is the molar heat capacity
* $C_{p,m} = C_{V,m} + R$ Specific and molar heat capacity for an ideal gas where $C_{p,m}$ is the molar heat capacity at constant pressure,$C_{V,m}$ is molar heat capacity at constant volume, and R is the universal gas constant
