Different Speed with which to launch objects horizontally will launch them into orbits. 

* For a circular orbit, a speed of 7.9 km/s (17,700 mph) is needed. At this speed, the object's centrifugal force exactly balances Earth's gravitational pull.
* For an elliptical orbit, a speed between 17700 mph and 25000 mph is needed. The object's speed varies throughout the orbit - fastest at perigee (closest point), slowest at apogee (farthest point)
* For escape velocity, you must exceed 11.2km/s (25000 mph).

These speeds assume no air resistance

Real spacecraft launch vertically first to clear the atmosphere, then pitch over to gain horizontal velocity, making the actual delta-v (change in velocity needed to perform a specific maneuver in space) requirements higher. The atmospheric drag and air resitance mean that the actual delta v to reach LEO is 9.4 km/s even though you only need 7.9 km/s once you reach space to maintain a circular orbit. This puts the spacecraft into Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
