This section focuses on the standardization of data to address the ambiguity present in data interpretation. Maintaining consistency in data definitions is crucial, and this can be achieved through human input to provide examples and ensure accurate labeling.

Andrew discusses the user ID merge problem, where data is sourced from both a website and a chatbot. A company may involve the product management team to manually identify whether the two data sources refer to the same person. This process aids in training the algorithm to make these determinations independently in the future.

The quality of input data is crucial for accurate defect detection. In the screenshot below, two photos of the same phone are shown; the second photo has significantly better lighting. This improved lighting allows the algorithm to detect defects more accurately.  Remember if a human can't even detect the defect, we can't expect an algorithm to.
