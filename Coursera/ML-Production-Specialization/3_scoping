Scoping is all about deciding what project to work on. When deciding, it's important to consider factors such as what are the metrics that the business is looking for and what are the resources that we have (data, time, and people).

When trying to brainstorm ideas with the business on what to work on. The first thing we want to ask is what are the business problems that the business wishes to solve. Maybe the problem is that they want more visitors to the website to be converted to customers or maybe they want to reduce the amout of inventory that they keep in the warehouse. It's important to focus on asking problems that the business is facing because then we'll determine if ML is even the correct approach.
