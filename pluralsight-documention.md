# Introduction to technical writing

Documentation is important for the following:

### Marketing

Documentation creates a way for users to see the good of your project

### Get Information on Paper

People will continuously ask how to use your project. Documentation will give you something to refer people to. This is better, faster, and less stressful than figuring out new ways to explain these things on the spot.

### Get the team on the same page

Team members involved in the project may not always be clear on what the other members of the project are doing. Documention provides a way to keep everyone involved in the project on the same page so that everyone clearly knows what they're doing and what the others are doing.

### Reduce support inquiries from users

Users may continuously call support because they've forgotten how to use the product and aren't clear. Documention will make users happier as well as reduce the calls to support.

### Documentation is a reflection of you and your project

If your documention has typos and is confusing, you and your project will lose credability

# The Writing Process

1. Plan

**Identify the Purpose**
Why will the document exist? Are you helping people to understand something. 
Identify the requirements of the project and see if it meets expectations
Define how the system will be constructed and how components will fit togther
Define test cases.

**Identify Audience**
Who will be reading the documentation? What state of mind is the user in? Are they stressed out and just need quick and easy docs?

**How will you deliver your work?** If you're audience is people without a stable internet connection, you may want to create  something for offline use.

2. Research

Ask the subject matter experts (SMEs) how to use the software. Even if you're a member of the software being written, it's still a good idea to consult with other members of the team.

3. Write

Organize your content. Write your first draft without worrying about grammer/spelling. Review and revise your documentation every once and awhile to be sure that you're staying on topic.

4. Review/Edit

Once your draft is complete, you'll want to review your docs once again so that you can reorganize your content and consult with others to ensure the docs flow well and have a good format. Ensure that your docs don't have verbose information that's unneeded.

5. Launch

Make sure to have a plan to keep documentation in sync with software.

# Writing Tips and Best Practices

Accuracy is better than speed so take your time to write documentation
Make sure to consult with the subject matter experts on what you're writing about.
Give an introduction or abstract of what you're doing first. This way, the reader doesn't need to read everything before they find out that this doesn't suit their needs.
Don't be afraid to use stronger language to get your point across.
* Convey only the needed information and avoid verbose information. You should trim the verbose information when you review and edit documentation.
* Only include the information necessary for that action of the documentation.
  * For example, if you have one document for quick start, installation, and troubleshooting, maybe those should all be seperate documents.
* Keep sentences short and sweet rather than wordy.
* Cut the "Fluffy" words such as good and very.
* Make use of graphs and charts when the information can use it.
* When determining the tone of your documentation, consider the audience that you're writing for.
  * Writing for 60 year old users, a formal tone would be needed
  * Writing for a startup of 20 somes would necessitate a more relaxed tone.
* Keep consistency in the tense of your document
* Grammar is a reflection of your image
 * "Set up" used as two words is a verb
 * "Setup" used as one word is a noun
 * This same distinction can be applied to "login" and "backup"
 * i.e. means that is
 * e.g. means for example
 * Warning call attention to dangers. Caution calls attention to anything that could result in damage. Note emphasizes important information but failure to read the note should not result in physical harm to the reader or equipment.
 * backward, toward, and forward should not have an s at the end of the words but often are written this way
 * double-click, right-click, and left-click should all be hyphenated
 * Web site was changed to website in 2010
 * e-mail was changed to email in 2011
