# Introduction to technical writing

Documentation is important for the following:

### Marketing

Documentation creates a way for users to see the good of your project

### Get Information on Paper

People will continuously ask how to use your project. Documentation will give you something to refer people to. This is better, faster, and less stressful than figuring out new ways to explain these things on the spot.

### Get the team on the same page

Team members involved in the project may not always be clear on what the other members of the project are doing. Documention provides a way to keep everyone involved in the project on the same page so that everyone clearly knows what they're doing and what the others are doing.

### Reduce support inquiries from users

Users may continuously call support because they've forgotten how to use the product and aren't clear. Documention will make users happier as well as reduce the calls to support.

### Documentation is a reflection of you and your project

If your documention has typos and is confusing, you and your project will lose credability
