# Introduction to technical writing

Documentation is important for the following:

### Marketing

Documentation creates a way for users to see the good of your project

### Get Information on Paper

People will continuously ask how to use your project. Documentation will give you something to refer people to. This is better, faster, and less stressful than figuring out new ways to explain these things on the spot.

### Get the team on the same page

Team members involved in the project may not always be clear on what the other members of the project are doing. Documention provides a way to keep everyone involved in the project on the same page so that everyone clearly knows what they're doing and what the others are doing.

### Reduce support inquiries from users

Users may continuously call support because they've forgotten how to use the product and aren't clear. Documention will make users happier as well as reduce the calls to support.

### Documentation is a reflection of you and your project

If your documention has typos and is confusing, you and your project will lose credability

# The Writing Process

1. Plan

**Identify the Purpose**
Why will the document exist? Are you helping people to understand something. 
Identify the requirements of the project and see if it meets expectations
Define how the system will be constructed and how components will fit togther
Define test cases.

**Identify Audience**
Who will be reading the documentation? What state of mind is the user in? Are they stressed out and just need quick and easy docs?

**How will you deliver your work?** If you're audience is people without a stable internet connection, you may want to create  something for offline use.

2. Research

Ask the subject matter experts (SMEs) how to use the software. Even if you're a member of the software being written, it's still a good idea to consult with other members of the team.

3. Write

Organize your content. Write your first draft without worrying about grammer/spelling. Review and revise your documentation every once and awhile to be sure that you're staying on topic.

4. Review/Edit

Once your draft is complete, you'll want to review your docs once again so that you can reorganize your content and consult with others to ensure the docs flow well and have a good format. Ensure that your docs don't have verbose information that's unneeded.

5. Launch

Make sure to have a plan to keep documentation in sync with software.
