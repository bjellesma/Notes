Snowflake is a data platform rather than just a data warehouse because of the following factor

Handles ALL data types and workloads
Multiple processing engines
Extensive ecosystem integrations
End-to-end data lifecycle management

snowflake has been built from the get go with the cloud in mind which is why we can refer to it as **cloud native**

all snowflake infra can run on cloud in aws, gcp, or azure

snowflake is described as a Software as a service (SaaS) because there is no management of hardware and it works on a subscription model.
