## Where we are

* Google alphazero in 2017 wrote an AI that trained and defeated a world champion program specifically developed for Chess
  * alphazero is unique because it designed tactics that weren't previously even conceived by humans. This is how it was able to beat programs because the programs need to be created with previous human knowledge
* A divide will be created between those who incorporate AI, like chatGPT, and those who either opt out or don't have the means to aquire/develop/incorporate this ai
* There are also malicious actors doing things like spreading misinformation
* the book provides a good example of how ai is now power search engines that, ten years ago, were powered by big data mining. With data mining, if a users searches for "gourmet" and then searches for "clothing", the results will be completely independant. In AI, if a user searches "gourmet" and then searches "clothing", the second search will be influenced by the first and the results might be designer clothing 
* the book argues that this is not the kind of AI that we see in sci fi that is all knowing because the ai we develop today is for a specific goal and measurable result like having the greatest win-lose ratio in 1000 games of chess

## How We Got Here

* The author argues that AI is the next logical step in scientific discovery. In the twientith century, we invented computers to augment our cognitive capabilities with advanced calculations. ai can be use to expand our capabilities in dicypering information and pattern recognition.
* Because there is so much information readily available, thanks to the internet, we need the help of ai to parse this information

# Where we are today

* Early ai research was progressive but gave way to the ai winter in the 80s and 90s when ai was unable to recognize images. 
* In the 90s, the thought arose that we needed **machine learning** so that the ai learns by having a catalogue of images.
* In the late 2000s was the idea of a **neural network** to simulate the brain
