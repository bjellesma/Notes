## Fusion Technology

* Stellarators and Tokamaks use nearly identical technology which is why the author is focusing on tokamaks
* a 4 Tesla field is about 1000x a fridge magnet and a little stronger than a field generated by an MRI
* The big problem is that the torrodial field coils need a large amount of electricity to generate the magnetic field necessary and copper has a lot of resisivity so the electrons bump into the atoms of the container.
* **Superconducting** materials can carry current with zero resistence. This means that we'll need dramatically less power to generate the magnetic field.
  * Addittionally, materials are only superconducting at low temperatures such as tens of degrees above absolute zero
* Besides torrodial field coils, there are also polodial field coils around the external side of the tokamak which cause the plasma to have a D shape.
* Three ways of heating the magnetic field
  * The **Central Solenoid** goes in the center of the tokamak and can provide inductive heating
  * **Neutral beam** - Shooting a beam of fast moving particles
  * **Electromagnetic Wave** - If a plasma wave is moving at the right speed, it can transfer energy to the particle
* The JET tokamak is the **Joint European Torus** and is located in Oxfordshire, England.
* The highest q factor attained as of now is q=0.7 by NIF
* The External part around the plasma is called the **First Wall** and is where the divertor sits
* Just outside of the first wall sits the **tritium breeding blanket** and is responsible for absorbing the neutrons generated by fusion in the plasma
  * The idea is that the neutrons from the D-T reaction will help breed tritium
* **Neutron Multipliers** undergo reactions that produce more neutrons than are required to create the reaction
  * Achieving even a factor of 1.5 is difficult
* By thermodynamics, the closer an object is to absolute zero, the more energy it takes to remove heat from the object
* Just outside of the blanket is the **Vacuum Vessel**. This is needed to keep air out of the plasma reaction. Any leak of air would rapidly cool the reaction.
* Small metal rods called **Langmuir probles** are stuck into the plasma edge to give us diagnostic information
* Not as much radioactive waste is produced by fusion but tritium is still radioactive so it's unsafe to go near a reactor while a reaction is occuring. However, most radiation produced by tritium ends up burned by the plasma

## State of Fission

* Companies like TerraPower are invested by Bill Gates and seek to bring in gen 4 nuclear fission plants
  * These gen 4 plants are safer to operate and produce about 80% less nuclear waste  
* The main arguement is that we can't necessarily wait on fusion and should pursue both at the same time
  * The US relies less on nuclear technology than other contries such as France because the US has more fears of using nuclear technology and storing waste

## The Past: Fusion Breakthroughs

* In 1993, Princeton becomes the first to produce significant fusion power of 10MW
* In 1986, the first High Temperature superconducting magnet was discovered. Though one benefit is that this permits operation above 30 degrees Kelvin, another significant benefit is that some magnets can sustain fields of 100 Tesla. 
 * Rare Earth Barium Copper Oxide (Rebco) coils have been used to generate fields of 30 tesla
 * another benefit is that the material for HTS can be designed with joints, enabling "plug and play" like behavior
