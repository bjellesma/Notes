## Fusion Technology

* when turbulence becomes stronger than the viscocity of the fluid. This when we see wild fluctuations in the fluid such as waves and air pockets. This is why viscous fluids like syrup are less prone to these fluctuations. Turbulence is one of the biggest problems for plasma confinement because plasma is so vulnerable to this.
* Stellerator is an alternative to tokamak and uses the same toroidial shape but with twisted coils
* The tokamak is in the shape on a donut or torus because that allows there to be no zero point of magnetic impact. Though use of torodial devices works for plasma containment, particles do suffer from drift every once and awhile
* The big problem with fusion has been that the containment time is far too low to sustain a fusion reaction (a successful ion collision)
* a plasma is a gas of free nuclei and electrons. A gas is heated to 10 KeV so that the kinetic energy of the moving particles in greater than the binding energy holding the electrons. This means that the electrons become ionized meaning they break free. Lightning is an example as are flourescent light bulbs. Fire can be considered to be weakly ionized
* Though there aren't many natural tritium sources on earth, we can make tritium by a fission reaction from lithium-6
* nucleon is just the general term for proton or neutron because they both live in the nucleus
* the boltzman constant is what is used to convert electron-volts to temperature
* the electron-volt (eV) is really smaller version of the joule because it measures the kinetic energy it takes to pass through 1 volt, which is extremely small
* the nuclear potential refers to the fact that as two nuclei get closer, the strong nuclear force takes over and can snap them together. The strong nuclear force is only active at about less than 3 femtometers, otherwise the electromagnetic force will work to repel the two nuclei
* the process of fossil fuel is similar to biomass but there are plants that have decompsed from anaerobic processes
* solar is one of the least green alternatives because the photovoltaics necessary release three times as much carbon as fission. This is still 10 times less than natural gas and other fossil fuels. The majority of natural gas is considered a fossil fuel because it uses heat and pressure from million year old organic material
* biomass is just using plants to store solar energy through photosynthesis and then burning it to spin a turbine
* one ton of uranium contains roughly the amount on energy needed to power germany for a week
* fusion processes are easy to stop while fission reactions are very difficult to stop. fission is hard to stop because when you hit a heavy element with a neutron, it breaks into a slightly lighter element but with more free neutrons that break more elements leading to a chain reaction. When these chain reactions occur, it leads to a lot of released heat where if there is not enough coolant in the system, it can melt the reactor core. This is what happened at three mile island and fukishima.
* The nuclear force keeping atoms together is a lot stronger than the electromagnetic force which is why we expect the yield of energy density to be so much more. Moreover fusion is expected to dwarf the energy density of fission by a factor of four
* Aside from the D T reaction, there's a harder fusion reaction called Deuterium Deuterium. This D D reaction requires higher temperature and has a lower probability of nuclei fusing but the advantage is that no tritium is required. This reaction can likely be achieved after we're able to master the D T reaction
* Though Deuterium can be found in a glass of water, tritium is harder to come by. The thought is that with the D T reaction, we can surround the fusion reactor in lithium and use the free neutron to transform into a helium atom and tritium atom (Lithium has 3 protons and 4 neutrons.
* Since fusion requires lighter elements, it has less of a chance to be weaponized
* Isotopes of elements have the same number of protons in their nucleus but a different number of nuetrons. Normal hydrogen has a single proton. Deuterium has one proton and one neurtron and tritium has one proton and two neutrons. The Deuterium Tritium reaction produces helium-4, an isotope of helium with two protons and two neurtrons along with one free neutron. This D T reaction offers the highest chance for two nuclei to fuse together at a lower temperature than would be required for other nuclei

* Stellarators and Tokamaks use nearly identical technology which is why the author is focusing on tokamaks
* a 4 Tesla field is about 1000x a fridge magnet and a little stronger than a field generated by an MRI
* The big problem is that the torrodial field coils need a large amount of electricity to generate the magnetic field necessary and copper has a lot of resisivity so the electrons bump into the atoms of the container.
* **Superconducting** materials can carry current with zero resistence. This means that we'll need dramatically less power to generate the magnetic field.
  * Addittionally, materials are only superconducting at low temperatures such as tens of degrees above absolute zero
* Besides torrodial field coils, there are also polodial field coils around the external side of the tokamak which cause the plasma to have a D shape.
* Three ways of heating the magnetic field
  * The **Central Solenoid** goes in the center of the tokamak and can provide inductive heating
  * **Neutral beam** - Shooting a beam of fast moving particles
  * **Electromagnetic Wave** - If a plasma wave is moving at the right speed, it can transfer energy to the particle
* The JET tokamak is the **Joint European Torus** and is located in Oxfordshire, England.
* The highest q factor attained as of now is q=0.7 by NIF
* The External part around the plasma is called the **First Wall** and is where the divertor sits
* Just outside of the first wall sits the **tritium breeding blanket** and is responsible for absorbing the neutrons generated by fusion in the plasma
  * The idea is that the neutrons from the D-T reaction will help breed tritium
* **Neutron Multipliers** undergo reactions that produce more neutrons than are required to create the reaction
  * Achieving even a factor of 1.5 is difficult
* By thermodynamics, the closer an object is to absolute zero, the more energy it takes to remove heat from the object
* Just outside of the blanket is the **Vacuum Vessel**. This is needed to keep air out of the plasma reaction. Any leak of air would rapidly cool the reaction.
* Small metal rods called **Langmuir probles** are stuck into the plasma edge to give us diagnostic information
* Not as much radioactive waste is produced by fusion but tritium is still radioactive so it's unsafe to go near a reactor while a reaction is occuring. However, most radiation produced by tritium ends up burned by the plasma

## State of Fission

* Companies like TerraPower are invested by Bill Gates and seek to bring in gen 4 nuclear fission plants
  * These gen 4 plants are safer to operate and produce about 80% less nuclear waste  
* The main arguement is that we can't necessarily wait on fusion and should pursue both at the same time
  * The US relies less on nuclear technology than other contries such as France because the US has more fears of using nuclear technology and storing waste

## The Past: Fusion Breakthroughs

* In 1993, Princeton becomes the first to produce significant fusion power of 10MW
* In 1986, the first High Temperature superconducting magnet was discovered. Though one benefit is that this permits operation above 30 degrees Kelvin, another significant benefit is that some magnets can sustain fields of 100 Tesla. 
 * Rare Earth Barium Copper Oxide (Rebco) coils have been used to generate fields of 30 tesla
 * another benefit is that the material for HTS can be designed with joints, enabling "plug and play" like behavior
 *  The D shape of fusion magnets was introduced with the JET tokamak and was found by researchers to have a better confinement time
 *  Tritium is about $1000 per gram while Deuritium is about $1 per gram
 *  In 1997, JET generated over 16mw of power and reached Q=0.7. This was done using D-T fuel proving that tritum, though more costly, can offer improved performance
 *  The problem with computing plasma simulations is that there are rought $10^{23}$ particles inside of a plasma moving every $10^{-12} seconds. This would take the biggest supercomputers $10^{31}$ years to complete as of the 2000s
  * as a result, simplified models are built. One such model is gyrokinetics. This model took until about the early 2000s to be feasible
  * These simplified models will reduce the number of particles and the speed of the particles which takes the computation time from years to one day. Still, this proves costly to use a supercomputer for this time

## The Present: ITER

* International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor
* ITER will produce no electricity and is largely a physics and engineering expirement that will pave the way for future tokamaks
* ITER is expected to have a confinement time of 5 minutes and reach Q=10
* it's estimated that 50MW of heating will be needed for plasma to occur
* The most powerful component of ITER's heating system (33MW) will be its two **neutral beam injectors**
 * The remainder of the heating will happen from an electron cyclotron (20MW) and ion cyclotron (20MW)
 * These add to more than 50MW because early ITER will use hydrogen as fuel instead of DT 
* When DT operation begins, any damage and cleaning inside the first wall will need to be done remotely because of the radiation exposure
* During the oil crisis in 1973, this was when funding for fusion research was at its highest
* ITER is scheduled to make its first plasma in 2025 with hydrogen fuel and will begin using DT fuel in 2035
* ITER was originally proposed in 1973 as Internation Tokamak Reactor, INTOR. It wasn't until 1985 that Gorbachev proposed ITER as a continuation to INTOR.
 * Originally, ITER would produce 1500 MW and cost 11 billion. This caused the US to leave. This prompted a redesign in three years to a modest 500 MW and 6 billion. This enticed the US to rejoin
 * Construction began in 2007 with the original first plasma scheduled for 2018 but the timeline has slipped to 2025 and costs have skyrocketed to 25 billion
 * while ITER (Even though China is a part of ITER already) is being constructed, China is working on its own reactor call Chinese Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR)
 
 ## The Future: Designing a Tokamak power plant
 
 * Fusion power density is proportional to the magnetic field strength to the forth power. Meaning if we increase the magnetic field strength by a factor of 2, the fusion power produced is increased by a factor of 16
 * Plasma Density is constrained by the GreenWald Limit while current is constrained by the kink limit
 * The divertor is a specialized part of the first wall that handles the power that continually leaks out of the plasma
 * Nuclear Fission plants generally cost about $10 billion where 75% of that is the initial cost of building the plant. Several government loans are also issued which means that a large portion of that money is allocated for interest on those loans.

## Alternative Approaches to Fusion Energy

* It looks like early commercial fusion power will be tokamaks but it could be stellerators
* The stellerator uses exernal coils bent into funky shapes![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7660667/205503676-26a7c59d-b9e0-48ca-906b-5eb93e433413.png)

* W7-X is a JET level stellerator being built in Germany and began constructtion is 2015
* Because of the geometry of a stellerator, it doesn't require as much power to heat the plasma. The largest power cost would be to keep the magnets cold. However remote maintenace on the stellerator would also be much more difficult.
* THe plasma duration in stellerators would also be longer because of the steady state properties of the devices
* Tokamaks and Stellerators use **magnetic confinement fusion** (MCF) and an alternative approach is **intertial confinement fusion** (ICF). ICF uses powerful lasers to imprlode small capsules of fusion fuel. These implosions will cause the center of the fuel to become very hot and dese. The release of heat will run a steam turbine which is how fusion will occure.
* the triple product of ICF is higher but ICF aims to go far beyond ignition is order to reach net positive energy produced. This is because the power required to reach ignition, like the lasers, is much higher
* Equipmen needed for tokamak
 * Vaccuum Vessel
 * Central Solonoid
 * Blanket
 * Neutron Shielding
 * Torodial Field Coils
* Fusion Startups
 * Tokamak Energy LTD.
  * a british startup using a spherical tokamak concept![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7660667/205506220-9b736ef5-2432-4aa0-8267-c474ba245491.png)
  * the spherical tokamak has advantages such as a longer proposed confinement time but it is more difficult to fit all of the equipment needed as the vaccuum vessel and the cental solonoid in the smaller area. Because of this, some of the equipment above needs to be sacrificed which means that it may require more heating power for example making net fusion energy more difficult to achieve
  * Despite this, they've made great strides in research for HTS magnets which can be very useful for fusion energy
 * General Fusion
  * using **magnetized target fusion** (MTF) which is a compromise between MCF and ICF. MCF aims for long confinement time and low density while ICF aims for short confinement and high density. MTF is in the middle for both these numbers. To attain this, MTF starts with MCF and ends with ICF. the disadvantage is that you get the technical complexities of both but the advantage is that you avoid some of the turbulence issues which is something that we have no solution for.
 * Lockheed Martin
  * They are secretive so we really do not know a lot
 * TAE Technologies
  * found in 1998 in California
  * Use proton-boron (PB) fueld. The reason they do this is because the reaction is **aneurtronic** meaning it produces no neutrons which greatly reduce the complexity of the proposed plant. This is an interesting choice since the typical D-T fuel output has been shown to be higher. Furthermore, P-B reaction produces higher radiation.
  * Use field reversed configurations which make better use of magnetic fields meaning that they can contain more plasma but it is difficult to confine the plasma in stead state for long periods of time
