* the idea of momentum was first thought of in the sixth century when a suggestion was made that a certain quantity from the bowstring was tranferred to the arrow

* A vector is often written with a bar over it as $\vec{v}$. We're often interested in the magnitude of this vector which can be written without the bar $v$

* A vector can be described by its **components** , the contributions it gets from different directions, like the x component and the y component

* **Vector addition** can be created by adding the tail end of the second vector to the head of the first vector ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7660667/203226333-9368013a-7ba7-4685-abf2-1c4fd64e02b0.png)

* Momentum is usually defined as the letter p named after the greek word and can be defined as mass times velocity, $\vec{p}=m \vec{v}$. Notice that the momentum vector points in the same direction as the velocity vector. This also represents the property of **proportionality**, a multiplicative change in one quantity implies a multiplication change in another quantity. For example, if you double the velocity, you double the momentum. 

* kinetic energy relates mass and velocity, $E_{kinetic} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$, this equation may look familiar and this is because kinetic energy can be thought of as the integral of momentum.

* The energy of an object at rest is $E_{rest}=m c^2. a relativistic equation, shows that conservation of mass, while a good approximation, is not strictly true

* Every Symetry has a corresponsing quantity that is conservered. For example, the symmetry of rotations relates to the conserved quantity of angular momentum

* **The Spherical Cow Philosophy** is named for a joke in the physics commutity where a physicist starts a lecture by saying "Let's assume a spherical cow" This is a nonsense statement but illustrates the fact that physicts will usually go about solving problems by making assumptions to solve the easy problem and then gradually add back complexity.

## Change

* In classical physics, change is described using a specific framework called the **Laplacian Paradign**
* While derivates calculate the rate of change, integrals calculate the total amount of change
* When you try a rock to a string, swing it around in a circle and feel the rock tug on you, this is **centrifigul force**. The force that you exert to keep the rock in a circular motion is **centripetal force**
* Newton's Laws
  1. Velocity will be constant when there is no force acting on it
  2. F=ma
  3. bodies act on each other with equal and opposite forces
* A function is simply taking one quantity as input and outputting a second quantity
  * A function must have a unique mapping meaning one input maps to one output. In a graph, this function never crosses over itself ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7660667/210119079-0aee473c-fec6-4d9a-a8c0-51475e583bf3.png)
* The integral and derivative can be thought of as inverse functions in that one function undoes the other
* Calculus in necessary because famous equations like Einsteins equations of spacetime curvature or Shrodinger's quantum mechanical equations are differential equations.

## Dynamics

* The idea of relative speeds was first introduced by Galileo but refined later by Einstein
* The **normal vector** is just perpendicular to the object. For example, the normal vector to a ball rolling on a hill would be the force exerted by the ground
* harmonic motion can be represented graphically by a sine wave
* **equilibrium** is a state where all forces are in balance
* Force on the system is just the derivative of potential energy
* Together, the set of all pssible positions and momenta for a system is known as the system's **phase space**
* A **Lagrangian** is the system's kinetic - potential energy. Therefore, **action** can be defined mathematically as the integral of the Lagrangian
* 

## Space

* a **space** is the set of all possible locations where something can happen
* The reason for the inverse square law as well as the fact that the area formula contains $\pi^2$ is because we live in 3 spatial dimensions. In general, in a universe where space is d dimensional, the force of gravity is proportial to $\frac{1}{r^{d-1}}$
* The **Hamilitonian** of a system is basically the energy of the system written in terms of the positions and momenta.
* Rate of change of momentum with time and rate of change of position with time are known as **Hamiltonian Equations**
  * rate of change of momentum with time = Minus the slope of potential energy with respect to positon
  * rate of change of position with time = slope of kinetic energy with respect to momentum
* If we take the **partial Derivative** with respect to x, we treat the other variables as constants and bring them outside of the derivative and get $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(axy^2) = (ay^2)(\frac{d}{dx}(x) = ay^2$
* a **field** is basically a function of space itself: at every point, the field takes on a certain value. Think of the magnetic field, the gravitational field, or others
  * the sun doesn't magically reach across space to exert a gravitational pull. Rather, it influences the gravitational field at its location, and the the value of the field at each location influences the value at all locations nearby. by concatenatiog all of these influences together with calculus, we can determine the strength of the gravitation pull.

## Time

* When we speak of properties such as temperature and pressure, we are describing **macrostates**. **Microstates** refer to individul position of atoms.
  * Ludwig Boltzmann** figured in the 1870s that low entropy systems refer to a smaller combination of microstates. So as time goes on, the numberof possible microstates increases, which means that the entropy increases in **closed systems**, systems that don't ineract with the external world. This is the **second law of thermodynamics**.
  * In an open system, entropy can decrease. For example, if you put a bottle in the fridge, the bottled substance cools, lowering the number of possible microstates, and therefore the entropy.
  * However, you'll notice that heat is still expeled by the fridge which is why you can't cool a room by leaving the fridge door open. This is the **first law of thermodynamics**

## Spacetime

* In the classic twin paradox where alice is on earth and bob is in a spaceship going 99 percent the speed of light, it's not that bob's watch ticks at a different rate, it's that bob experiences less proper time
  * To calculate how much less we use the equation $\tau = \sqrt{1-v^2}\delta t$ where v=.99 in this case. If we assume that $\tau =1$, this means that $\delta t = \frac{1}{.14} which is approximately 7. This means that Alice experience 7 years of proper time for every one of Bob's and that Alice will be aged more.
* Paths in spacetime that move at the speed of light are called **null trajectories** because they don't experience the passage of time
* The spacetime arena for all of this is called **Minkowski Spacetime** and replaces the notion of the **luminiferous aether** which is the proposed invisible substance that permeated space proposed in the 1850s. Minkowski Spacetime was proposed in 1905 when Einstein's paper on special relativity in 1905
* For any one event on Earth there is a span of eight years that could be considered simultaneous in Proxima Centuri, the closest star system, depending on your time frame
* Einstein's famouse e=mc^2 is an example of the **energy is the timelike version of momentum** that came from special relativity
