* the idea of momentum was first thought of in the sixth century when a suggestion was made that a certain quantity from the bowstring was tranferred to the arrow

* A vector is often written with a bar over it as $\vec{v}$. We're often interested in the magnitude of this vector which can be written without the bar $v$

* A vector can be described by its **components** , the contributions it gets from different directions, like the x component and the y component

* **Vector addition** can be created by adding the tail end of the second vector to the head of the first vector ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7660667/203226333-9368013a-7ba7-4685-abf2-1c4fd64e02b0.png)

* Momentum is usually defined as the letter p named after the greek word and can be defined as mass times velocity, $\vec{p}=m \vec{v}$. Notice that the momentum vector points in the same direction as the velocity vector. This also represents the property of **proportionality**, a multiplicative change in one quantity implies a multiplication change in another quantity. For example, if you double the velocity, you double the momentum. 

* kinetic energy relates mass and velocity, $E_{kinetic} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$, this equation may look familiar and this is because kinetic energy can be thought of as the integral of momentum.

* The energy of an object at rest is $E_{rest}=m c^2. a relativistic equation, shows that conservation of mass, while a good approximation, is not strictly true

* Every Symetry has a corresponsing quantity that is conservered. For example, the symmetry of rotations relates to the conserved quantity of angular momentum

* **The Spherical Cow Philosophy** is named for a joke in the physics commutity where a physicist starts a lecture by saying "Let's assume a spherical cow" This is a nonsense statement but illustrates the fact that physicts will usually go about solving problems by making assumptions to solve the easy problem and then gradually add back complexity.

## Change

* In classical physics, change is described using a specific framework called the **Laplacian Paradign**
* While derivates calculate the rate of change, integrals calculate the total amount of change
* When you try a rock to a string, swing it around in a circle and feel the rock tug on you, this is **centrifigul force**. The force that you exert to keep the rock in a circular motion is **centripetal force**
* Newton's Laws
  1. Velocity will be constant when there is no force acting on it
  2. F=ma
  3. bodies act on each other with equal and opposite forces
* A function is simply taking one quantity as input and outputting a second quantity
  * A function must have a unique mapping meaning one input maps to one output. In a graph, this function never crosses over itself ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7660667/210119079-0aee473c-fec6-4d9a-a8c0-51475e583bf3.png)
