* the idea of momentum was first thought of in the sixth century when a suggestion was made that a certain quantity from the bowstring was tranferred to the arrow

* A vector is often written with a bar over it as $\vec{v}$. We're often interested in the magnitude of this vector which can be written without the bar $v$

* A vector can be described by its **components** , the contributions it gets from different directions, like the x component and the y component

* **Vector addition** can be created by adding the tail end of the second vector to the head of the first vector ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7660667/203226333-9368013a-7ba7-4685-abf2-1c4fd64e02b0.png)

* Momentum is usually defined as the letter p named after the greek word and can be defined as mass times velocity, $\vec{p}=m \vec{v}$. Notice that the momentum vector points in the same direction as the velocity vector. This also represents the property of **proportionality**, a multiplicative change in one quantity implies a multiplication change in another quantity. For example, if you double the velocity, you double the momentum. 

* kinetic energy relates mass and velocity, $E_{kinetic} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$, this equation may look familiar and this is because kinetic energy can be thought of as the integral of momentum.

* The energy of an object at rest is $E_{rest}=m c^2. a relativistic equation, shows that conservation of mass, while a good approximation, is not strictly true

* Every Symetry has a corresponsing quantity that is conservered. For example, the symmetry of rotations relates to the conserved quantity of angular momentum

* **The Spherical Cow Philosophy** is named for a joke in the physics commutity where a physicist starts a lecture by saying "Let's assume a spherical cow" This is a nonsense statement but illustrates the fact that physicts will usually go about solving problems by making assumptions to solve the easy problem and then gradually add back complexity.
