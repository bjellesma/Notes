* Most people in the world are suffering the results of the climate crisis that they did not start
* The book largely argues that we can use the climate crisis as an oppurtunity to touch other social issues such as rebuilding democracy and closing the gap between the rich and poor
* During world world war II, use of gardens and public transit went up
  * The Arguement here is that we've made sacrifices before but we're unable to now because we want to protect the interests of the super wealthy who may not share these values

## The right is right

* I like how the author gives the perspective of a denialist conference. Most of these people are engineers and lawyers but are conviced that they've outsmarted 97% of scientists
* There is actually evidence that the wealthy often point to that climate change is actually leading to longer growing seasons
* Wealthier parts of the world have funds to put up stuff like seawalls and other expensive safeguards

## Hot Money

* If we had started reducing emissions in 1992 when a lot of these concerns were raised in the signing of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCoCC), we could have been much more managable and reduced emissions by 2% every year
 * The Problem is that this agreement was largely on the honor system while NAFTA, signed the same year, had real teeth  
 * Historically, one percent reductions have only been associated with economic recessions
* The arguement is that the government has made deals and subsidies with fossil feul companies that essentially make it almost illegal to have competition that will fight climate change
* emissions produced when one country orders goods from another are attributed to that other country so that the first country is still allowed to report that their emissions have gone down
* Free trade has allowed companies to move operations when labor costs start rising, which is many companies begin moving their operations to China or Bangledesh even though the economic model still comes from the US. In the days before free trade, companies were forced to abide to higher labor costs and improve environmental standards when forced to by the public
* Many climate change deniers claim that global warming is a plot to redistribute wealth. This is partly correct because it does involve giving wealth to lower income communities to increase access to public housing/transit

## Public and Paid for

* The arguement here is that utilities should be controlled by the public sector so that residents are able to vote
* It was said that the transition to clean energy would require effot comparible to the Apollo project or the consruction of the highway system
* Jimmy Carter had a speech in 1979 to conserve, due to the energy crisis, and it's widely thought that is why he lost his re-election

## Planning and Banning

* The 2008 financial crisis with banks and car companies going belly up was a rare oppurtunity to build a more sustainable economy but Obama was unable to do this because he was convinced, like many others, that telling large companies how to better run their companies was a vaguely communist idea. The difficult part is that job creation is seen as more important and politically motivating.
* What's strange is that a survey is saying that 68% of voters prefer the generation of electricity to be in the public sector whereas we're building a nuclear fusion plant to be run in the private sector
* **agroecology** is a practice that famers employ to use more sustainable tools like pesticides to actually increase crop yields
* natural gas is still a fossil fuel but is more clean than burning coal.
* Though germany has been very successful in transitioning the majority of their country to renewable, there have also been setbacks in 2012 and 2013 because restrictions have also been lifted on the small number of companies still burning coal
 * Germany has simultaniously rejected nuclear power as they take 20 years to build, the unearthing of the minerals needed for uranium is climate intensive, and people fear nuclear in the wake of fukashima
* The fear for the big gas and oil companies is that if the politics change to disallow unearthing natural gas through fracking, all of the oil tankers, that cost billions of dollars, become stranded assets so investors will stop investing
* fossil feul companies can legally bribe congress and other campaigns in the form of donations
* the difficulty with arguing climate action is how do you persuade people that they should put the future ahead of the present? The followup is that climate action is many peoples (climate refugees in particular) best hope for a better present. It's everyone's more exciting future. 
* In this way, climate action is a larger set encompassing other subset social issues like Women's right and equity.
* Social movements of today lack must structure which is why the author thinks that they are largely ineffective
