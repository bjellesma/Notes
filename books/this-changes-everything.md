* Most people in the world are suffering the results of the climate crisis that they did not start
* The book largely argues that we can use the climate crisis as an oppurtunity to touch other social issues such as rebuilding democracy and closing the gap between the rich and poor
* During world world war II, use of gardens and public transit went up
  * The Arguement here is that we've made sacrifices before but we're unable to now because we want to protect the interests of the super wealthy who may not share these values

## The right is right

* I like how the author gives the perspective of a denialist conference. Most of these people are engineers and lawyers but are conviced that they've outsmarted 97% of scientists
* There is actually evidence that the wealthy often point to that climate change is actually leading to longer growing seasons
* Wealthier parts of the world have funds to put up stuff like seawalls and other expensive safeguards

## Hot Money

* If we had started reducing emissions in 1992 when a lot of these concerns were raised in the signing of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCoCC), we could have been much more managable and reduced emissions by 2% every year
 * The Problem is that this agreement was largely on the honor system while NAFTA, signed the same year, had real teeth  
 * Historically, one percent reductions have only been associated with economic recessions
* The arguement is that the government has made deals and subsidies with fossil feul companies that essentially make it almost illegal to have competition that will fight climate change
* emissions produced when one country orders goods from another are attributed to that other country so that the first country is still allowed to report that their emissions have gone down
* Free trade has allowed companies to move operations when labor costs start rising, which is many companies begin moving their operations to China or Bangledesh even though the economic model still comes from the US. In the days before free trade, companies were forced to abide to higher labor costs and improve environmental standards when forced to by the public
* Many climate change deniers claim that global warming is a plot to redistribute wealth. This is partly correct because it does involve giving wealth to lower income communities to increase access to public housing/transit

## Public and Paid for

* The arguement here is that utilities should be controlled by the public sector so that residents are able to vote
* It was said that the transition to clean energy would require effot comparible to the Apollo project or the consruction of the highway system
* Jimmy Carter had a speech in 1979 to conserve, due to the energy crisis, and it's widely thought that is why he lost his re-election
* \

## Planning and Banning

* The 2008 financial crisis with banks and car companies going belly up was a rare oppurtunity to build a more sustainable economy but Obama was unable to do this because he was convinced, like many others, that telling large companies how to better run their companies was a vaguely communist idea. The difficult part is that job creation is seen as more important and politically motivating.
* What's strange is that a survey is saying that 68% of voters prefer the generation of electricity to be in the public sector whereas we're building a nuclear fusion plant to be run in the private sector
* **agroecology** is a practice that famers employ to use more sustainable tools like pesticides to actually increase crop yields
* natural gas is still a fossil fuel but is more clean than burning coal.
* Though germany has been very successful in transitioning the majority of their country to renewable, there have also been setbacks in 2012 and 2013 because restrictions have also been lifted on the small number of companies still burning coal
 * Germany has simultaniously rejected nuclear power as they take 20 years to build, the unearthing of the minerals needed for uranium is climate intensive, and people fear nuclear in the wake of fukashima
* The fear for the big gas and oil companies is that if the politics change to disallow unearthing natural gas through fracking, all of the oil tankers, that cost billions of dollars, become stranded assets so investors will stop investing
* fossil feul companies can legally bribe congress and other campaigns in the form of donations
* the difficulty with arguing climate action is how do you persuade people that they should put the future ahead of the present? The followup is that climate action is many peoples (climate refugees in particular) best hope for a better present. It's everyone's more exciting future. 
* In this way, climate action is a larger set encompassing other subset social issues like Women's right and equity.
* Social movements of today lack must structure which is why the author thinks that they are largely ineffective

## Beyond Extractivism

* Extractivism is a political science term meaning that we live in the fantasy that Earth's resouces are infinite when in fact they are finite
* Francis Bacon was a 15th century English Philosopher and Statesman that first came up with the idea that we need to control nature
 * The Irony is that he died from a cold from being out in Nature 
* James Watt invented the steam engine
* Besides fossil fuels taking carbon from dead life forms in the ground and releasing them into the atmosphere, it's also releasing harmful toxins and such into the ocean
* 

## Fruits not roots

* The carbon credit process has created a system where companies receive more for artificially created dirtier fuel and then cleaning it than legit cleaner fuel

## No Messiahs

* Richard Branson, among other billionaires, is analyzed for making pledges of his ventures to try to help decarbonize and then polluting more while trying to expand the virgin empire.
* Several wealthy philanthropists look at zero carbon miracles rather than use existing technologies
* What I do not like about what the author is implying that we need to hold the wealthy to a higher standard and visibly scrutinize everything that they do, forgetting that they are only human

## Dimming the sun

* In 1991, mount Pinatubo erupted which actually caused a .7% decrease in global temperatures. As a result, one thought has always been to simulate this mount Pinatubo effect as a backup plan for dealing with climate change. Most scientists agree that this is a backup solution to plan A of cutting emissions
 * although there is a former CTO at Microsoft that says that we should use this effect as the full solution for dealing with climate change and not deal with emissions reduction at all because it would be a cheaper and easier solution.
 * The problem with this geoengineering approach is that
  * There is no full scale test. We got straight from simulation to implementation
  * History of eruptions tells us that the aftermath effects, such as flooding, occur disproportionatly creating an ethical issue
* In my mind, the problem with the geoengineering approach is that it doesnt mitigate the problem that we are using a set of finite resources
 * To go along with this, I think a very big problem with fossil fuels, regardless of impact on the environment, is that it is not as economically feasible because it is not sustainable

## Blockadia

* Big Gas and Oil made the stupid mistake of try to pipelines into college towns and very liberal places which sparked a lot of activism. This activism led to bans on fracking. France actually became the first country in 2011 to do a nationwide fracking ban
* Tar Sands are much more harmful for the local ecology and harder to clean up
* Several health risks diagnosed by doctors related to environmental impact of tar sands have been attempted to be rebuked by the industry. This resonates because people talk about the risks of radiation from nuclear a lot
* Since fracking usually takes place deep underground, the damage seems less visible. However, a study linked fracking with the emergence of 109 small earthquakes in an area where previously an earthquake had not been recorded since the 18th century
* In places where fracking is occuring, this contaminates the water supply and people's water coming from faucets is able to be set on fire because it's so flammible with methane soak
* BP suffered a major oil spill in 2010 off the gulf of mexico when an oil tanker exploded which also killed 11 workers

## Love Will Save This Place

* Modern Fracking and the use of tar sands requires a lot more water. Most of this water turns to waste or is radioactive so that it cannot be reused
* The idea is that if large organizations such as colleges and religious groups begin to sell off their investments in fossil fuel companies, it will chip away at the reputation of the fossil fuel industry

## You and what army

* For indigienous people, it's difficult when the the ice is never solid due to climate change to get food. But this creates a lot of political pressure to accept financial assistance from companies like Shell when they're offering things like job training and resource sharing.
* The big point is that the big polluting companies will offer these temporary life rafts to people that they've disenfranchised in the first place so they have no choice.

## The Leap Years

* The profits that the fossil fuel companies would miss out on, $10 trillion, are being compared with the profits that slave owners missed out on. Our government ended up subsidising most of the slave owers as a way to make up the cost
* Adam Smith said that using a cheaply paid laborer is more economical than owning a slave because you're responsible for the wear and tear on a slave and the laborers have more incentive to work harder. He didn't pay attention to the massive moral issues of slavery that society was focused on 
* The arguement is that climate action, much like abolition of slavery, will be won by arguing against the humanitarian crisis that it's caused and not an economical arguement
