* Most people in the world are suffering the results of the climate crisis that they did not start
* The book largely argues that we can use the climate crisis as an oppurtunity to touch other social issues such as rebuilding democracy and closing the gap between the rich and poor
* During world world war II, use of gardens and public transit went up
  * The Arguement here is that we've made sacrifices before but we're unable to now because we want to protect the interests of the super wealthy who may not share these values

## The right is right

* I like how the author gives the perspective of a denialist conference. Most of these people are engineers and lawyers but are conviced that they've outsmarted 97% of scientists
* There is actually evidence that the wealthy often point to that climate change is actually leading to longer growing seasons
* Wealthier parts of the world have funds to put up stuff like seawalls and other expensive safeguards

## Hot Money

* If we had started reducing emissions in 1992 when a lot of these concerns were raised in the signing of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCoCC), we could have been much more managable and reduced emissions by 2% every year
 * The Problem is that this agreement was largely on the honor system while NAFTA, signed the same year, had real teeth  
 * Historically, one percent reductions have only been associated with economic recessions
* The arguement is that the government has made deals and subsidies with fossil feul companies that essentially make it almost illegal to have competition that will fight climate change
* emissions produced when one country orders goods from another are attributed to that other country so that the first country is still allowed to report that their emissions have gone down
* Free trade has allowed companies to move operations when labor costs start rising, which is many companies begin moving their operations to China or Bangledesh even though the economic model still comes from the US. In the days before free trade, companies were forced to abide to higher labor costs and improve environmental standards when forced to by the public
* Many climate change deniers claim that global warming is a plot to redistribute wealth. This is partly correct because it does involve giving wealth to lower income communities to increase access to public housing/transit
