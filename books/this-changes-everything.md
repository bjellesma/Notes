* Most people in the world are suffering the results of the climate crisis that they did not start
* The book largely argues that we can use the climate crisis as an oppurtunity to touch other social issues such as rebuilding democracy and closing the gap between the rich and poor
* During world world war II, use of gardens and public transit went up
  * The Arguement here is that we've made sacrifices before but we're unable to now because we want to protect the interests of the super wealthy who may not share these values

## The right is right

* I like how the author gives the perspective of a denialist conference. Most of these people are engineers and lawyers but are conviced that they've outsmarted 97% of scientists
