## Phasers and Death Stars

* lasers (light amplification through stimulated emition of radiation) was first thought of 1935 when a team of physicists found that through pumping energy (in the form of electricity, radio, or chemical reactions) into a medium such as a special gas, cyrastal, or a diode, the energy would excite the atoms of the medium so that the electrons move to the outer shells. Because this medium is now in an unstable state, sending in a light beam, the photons will cause the atoms to suddenly decay to a lower level. The key is that in certain substances, the photons are vibrating in unison, or lase, and this becomes a dominoe effect creating a pencil thin laser beam.
* contrary to how it's typically portrayed, a laser beam doesn't stay pencil thin forever but yet gradually expands. For example, a laser beam shot toward the moon will eventually expand to be a couple miles wide.
* The problem with having typical ray guns as in star wars is that we need a power pack about the power of a power station
* **Light Sabers** have been thought to be impossible in real life because light cannot exist as a solid nor can it be contained. light would continue into the sky.
* Light Sabers could be possible as a plasma or superhot ionized gas through fusion
* The **Lawson Criterion** states that a specific range of temperature, density, and time must be achieved to begin the fusion process
