## Phasers and Death Stars

* lasers (light amplification through stimulated emition of radiation) was first thought of 1935 when a team of physicists found that through pumping energy (in the form of electricity, radio, or chemical reactions) into a medium such as a special gas, cyrastal, or a diode, the energy would excite the atoms of the medium so that the electrons move to the outer shells. Because this medium is now in an unstable state, sending in a light beam, the photons will cause the atoms to suddenly decay to a lower level. The key is that in certain substances, the photons are vibrating in unison, or lase, and this becomes a dominoe effect creating a pencil thin laser beam.
* contrary to how it's typically portrayed, a laser beam doesn't stay pencil thin forever but yet gradually expands. For example, a laser beam shot toward the moon will eventually expand to be a couple miles wide.
* The problem with having typical ray guns as in star wars is that we need a power pack about the power of a power station
* **Light Sabers** have been thought to be impossible in real life because light cannot exist as a solid nor can it be contained. light would continue into the sky.
* Light Sabers could be possible as a plasma or superhot ionized gas through fusion
* The **Lawson Criterion** states that a specific range of temperature, density, and time must be achieved to begin the fusion process

## Starships

* A **Von neuman probe** is what we call a nanoship that will be designed to go to a star system, build a nanofactory, and then create more probes; it's self replicating

## Antimatter

* In the 1930s, the first positron (anti-electron) was discovered
* In the 1950s in UC Berekly, the first antiproton was discovered
* In 1995, CERN made history when it announced that it made nine atons of antihydrogen
* The economics of antimatter are staggering as it would cost $20 Quadrillion dollors to even make 1 gram of antimatter
* The amount of antimatter that's available today is enough to power one light bulb for a few minutes but theoretically this can be limitless energy if the reactions are controlled
* The engines on the starship enterprise use antimatter reacting with normal matter
* Physists estimate that as little as 4 milligrams of positrons could take an antimatter rocket to mars in a few weeks
* Antimatter was first proposed in 1928 by Paul Dirac, he found that Einstein's equation should really be plus or minus m c squared. 5 years later, Carl Andrsen discovered the positron which lead to Dirac winning the Nobel Prize

## Faster than light

* An **Einstein Rosen Bridge** is a theorized bridge within a black hole that can take you to a parallel universe
* Because light is trapped in a black hole, you would see all of the light in the black hole
* A wormhole would have to exist in space already as we can't generate one with the push of a button
