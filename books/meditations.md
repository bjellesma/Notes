* Don't let external things distract you so much
* Consider how temporary things are in life
* remember that all is opinon
* never do anything rashly, feignly, or hypocritically. Be sure in everything and put your whole self into it
* everything has some kind of pleasing property to it even if it appears revolting at first. For example, a frothing wild boar.
* Don't do anything with reluctancy but be sure of your actions
* Be sure of every action and consider it as fully as possible
* Never esteem to anything profitable if it means breaking your own faith. always be ready as if today was your last day.
* always have your dogmata, knowledge and opinion of morals at the ready
* Don't be distracted by fancies in life
