# Engine
  
  * Usually you find that the few cylinders, the more fuel efficient. This also means that more cylinders correspond to more powerful vehicles

* the floor of a combustion chamber is the also the top of a piston. A **piston** moves up and down as the engine runs.

* When people say that their engine is a V8, this still means that it's 8 cyliners but arranged in a V shape with 4 cylinders on each side.
* The engine is divided into the engine head and the engine block. The **engine block** contains the cylinders with an equal number of those cylinders on each side.
  * Each cylinder contains it's own piston and the motion of each piston is what creates the motion of the car.
  * Each cylinder contains its own combustion chamber
    * * fuel burns in combustion chambers. One combustion chamber is directly above earch cylinder with a piston sliding in each cylinder. The explosive force created in a combustion chamber pushes a piston down, creating the motion which moves a car.
      * * Therefore the number of combustion chambers corresponds to the number of cylinders. Typically passenger cars are 4 cylinder, SUVs are 6 cylinders, and trucks are 8 cylinder.
* There is typically one **crankshaft** in an engine which the pistons will control by their motion up and down. The crankshaft will then send power to the transmission.
  * Think of the order of events that move the car like this: It's like a line of dominoes where each component transfers energy to the next:
Combustion → Pistons → Connecting Rods → Crankshaft → Transmission → Wheels
* The crankshaft is surrounded by five (this is a common number but not hard set) **main bearings** which help to keep to keep the crankshaft in place with the fast motion of the pistons.
* A **piston** will resemble an empty soup can and the explosive power of ignition will push the piston down. The pistons are all connected to the crankshaft by **connecting rods**.
  * Each piston has a set of **compression rings** (top) and **oil rings** (lower) between the piston and the cylinder. The compression ring is to absorb the impact from the piston while the oil ring is meant to prevent oil in the crankcase from splashing and seeping into a combustion chamber.
* A **camshaft** can be thought of as the mechanical brain of the engine which is responsible for coordinating all of the major parts. It uses egg shaped lobes to control the timing on the opening and closing of the engine valves which regulate the flow of fuel through an engine.
  * the camshaft is located directly above the crankshaft.
  * the crankshaft and camshaft are connected by a **timing belt**. This belt lines up literal marks on the crankshaft and camshaft sprocket to make sure that they stay in sync. Mechanics have to make sure that these line up when replacing this part.
* A **cylinder head** is a solid metal piece that fits on top of an engine block. Rounded indentations in a head provide space for the combustion chambers and it's a foundation for a valve assembly.
* * Each Clylinder has its own sparkplug. A **sparkplug** is used to ignite combusion in each combusion chamber. It works because the ignition system will send electricity to the sparkplugs which will cause combustion to occur.
* Each combustion chamber has one valve to let the fuel-air mixture in called the **intake valve** and one to let the exhaust out called the **exhaust valve**
* The **valve assembly** is the name for the series of parts between the valves and the lobes of the camshaft.
