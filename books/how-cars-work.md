# Engine
  
  * Usually you find that the few cylinders, the more fuel efficient. This also means that more cylinders correspond to more powerful vehicles

* The number of combustion chambers that a car has corresponds to the number of cylinders. a chamber is directy above each cylinder
* the floor of a combustion chamber is the also the top of a piston. A **piston** moves up and down as the engine runs.

* When people say that their engine is a V8, this still means that it's 8 cyliners but arranged in a V shape with 4 cylinders on each side.
* The explosive force created inside a combustion chamber pushes a piston down, creating the motion which moves the car. This up and down movement changes to spinning motion by that action of the **crankshaft**. This spinning motion (angular momentum) is what rotates the wheels. 
* The engine is divided into the engine head and the engine block. The **engine block** contains the cylinders with an equal number of those cylinders on each side.
  * Each cylinder contains it's own piston and the motion of each piston is what creates the motion of the car.
  * Each cylinder contains its own combustion chamber
    * * fuel burns in combustion chambers. One combustion chamber is directly above earch cylinder with a piston sliding in each cylinder. The explosive force created in a combustion chamber pushes a piston down, creating the motion which moves a car.
      * * Therefore the number of combustion chambers corresponds to the number of cylinders. Typically passenger cars are 4 cylinder, SUVs are 6 cylinders, and trucks are 8 cylinder.
* There is typically one **crankshaft** in an engine which the pistons will control by their motion up and down. The crankshaft will then send power to the transmission.
  * Think of the order of events that move the car like this: It's like a line of dominoes where each component transfers energy to the next:
Combustion → Pistons → Connecting Rods → Crankshaft → Transmission → Wheels
* The crankshaft is surrounded by five (this is a common number but not hard set) **main bearings** which help to keep to keep the crankshaft in place with the fast motion of the pistons.
* A **piston** will resemble an empty soup can and the explosive power of ignition will push the piston down. The pistons are all connected to the crankshaft by **connecting rods**.
  * Each piston has a set of **compression rings** (top) and **oil rings** (lower) between the piston and the cylinder. The compression ring is to absorb the impact from the piston while the oil ring is meant to prevent oil in the crankcase from splashing and seeping into a combustion chamber.
* A **camshaft** can be thought of as the mechanical brain of the engine which is responsible for coordinating all of the major parts. It uses egg shaped lobes to control the timing on the opening and closing of the engine valves which regulate the flow of fuel through an engine.
  * The crankshaft sits low in the engine block, at the bottom of the cylinders while the crankshaft typically sits above it
  * the crankshaft and camshaft are connected by a **timing belt**. This belt lines up literal marks on the crankshaft and camshaft sprocket to make sure that they stay in sync. Mechanics have to make sure that these line up when replacing this part.
* A **cylinder head** is a solid metal piece that fits on top of an engine block. Rounded indentations in a head provide space for the combustion chambers and it's a foundation for a valve assembly.
* * Each Clylinder has its own sparkplug. A **sparkplug** is used to ignite combusion in each combusion chamber. It works because the ignition system will send electricity to the sparkplugs which will cause combustion to occur.
* Each combustion chamber has one valve to let the fuel-air mixture in called the **intake valve** and one to let the exhaust out called the **exhaust valve**
* The **valve assembly** is the name for the series of parts between the valves and the lobes of the camshaft.

## Drive Train

A **drive train** includes the many parts that transfer spinning motion from an engine to the wheels. It has three jobs:
1. Transferring spin force from and engine to the sheels
2. Changing the rate of spin delivered to the wheels by shifting gears.
3. Connecting and disconnecting an engine from the wheels in order to start or idle.

**Front-wheel drive (FWD)** sends power only to the front wheels. The engine, transmission, and drive axle are all packaged together up front, which saves space and weight. This is the most common setup in sedans and crossovers. It handles well in rain and light snow since the weight of the engine sits over the driven wheels, giving them better traction.

**Rear-wheel drive (RWD)** sends power only to the rear wheels. A driveshaft runs from the transmission at the front to a differential at the back. This layout offers better weight distribution and handling dynamics, which is why it's preferred for sports cars, luxury sedans, and trucks. The tradeoff is worse traction in slippery conditions since the lighter rear end can lose grip more easily.

**Four-wheel drive (4WD)** sends power to all four wheels but is typically designed for off-road or rugged conditions. Most 4WD systems have a transfer case that lets you switch between two-wheel and four-wheel drive, sometimes with low-range gearing for crawling over obstacles. Common in trucks and SUVs. You generally don't want to run 4WD on dry pavement because the locked drivetrain can bind up in turns.

**All-wheel drive (AWD)** also powers all four wheels but operates automatically and continuously. The system distributes torque between front and rear (and sometimes side to side) as needed based on traction conditions. It's designed for on-road use in varying weather rather than serious off-roading. Most modern crossovers and performance cars use AWD.
The main distinction between 4WD and AWD is that 4WD is typically selectable and built for off-road capability, while AWD is always-on and optimized for on-road traction.

A manual transmission will typically have three to six gears with big rig trucks having up to 36. 

Rear-wheel drive was the dominant configuration in American cars through the 1970s and earlier. It was just how cars were built—a longitudinally-mounted engine up front, a transmission behind it, a driveshaft running to the rear axle.

The clutch disconnects the engine from the transmission, unloading the gears so you can move the shifter. Releasing the clutch reconnects them. You do this for every gear change.

In automatic transmission vehicles, a torque converter takes the place of the cluth. The **torque converter** uses the viscosity and kinetic energy of a liquid, **transmission fluid**, to transfer the spinning power of an engine to a drive train.

**Universal Joints** transfer spinning power through the changing angles from road bumps and the sway caused by steering around corners.
When starting from a stop, you release the clutch gradually (slipping it) so the car can accelerate smoothly without stalling the engine.

## Fuel System

A fuel system has three basic jobs:

1. Supply an engine with fuel
2. Mix this fuel continuously with air in varying combinations
3. to discharge the burned remains safetly

Air flows into an engine and gasoline droplets are mixed into this air-flow. The air/fuel mixture then burns in the combustion chambers, and the exhaust is blown out the tail pipe.

A carburetor controls the amount and mixtture of fuel delivered to an engine. This is largely historical and this is done by a fuel injection system now is used which uses a nozzle to spray the fuel. 

The **fuel pump** is used to deliver gasoline from the tank to the engine so that the fuel injectors can use it.

**Air filters** are used to trap dirt so that they don't enter the engine.

A **turbocharger** will control the volume of air/fuel mixture delivered to the engine to boost power.

A **catalytic converter** is a mechanism that sits under a car and reacts with hydrocarbons in exhaust gases and chemically converts them to water and other less harmful compounds. It's an example of an emmission control system.

## Cooling System

A cooling system uses a mixture of water and antifreeze to absorb and disperse engine heat. This mixture is known as **coolant**. This coolant flows around the outside of an engine with a water pump to absorb heat. The hot coolant then circulates to a radiator where excess heat radiates to the outside. A thermostat sits on top of the engine to regulate the amount of coolant being used. 

A cooling fan is used to cool an engine.

A car heater uses excess heat from a cooling system to warm a passenger compartment. This is one reason electric cars actually struggle with heating because they don't have the internal combustion engine. In an internal combustion engine, it costs no extra fuel to use the heater. By contrast, it does cost extra fuel to use the air conditioning system because it has a compressor that pressurizes refrigerant and that compressor is driven by the engine via a belt.
