## Five tips for communication

* Facts
    * Use facts first. Add emotion later
* Conviction
    * Be Confident, you are the expert
* Transparency
    * Be prepared to explain decisions
* Consistency
    * Use clarity. Be consise. You can tell more with a diagram
* Direction
    * Present people with a roadmap and drive change
 
## Plan Effectively

You should organize your goals into quarterly, cycle, and weekly goals. 
Be constantly grooming, updating, and re-prioritizing these goals. 
Be transparent with these goals with management and peers and whoever has a vested interest in you. 
They can help to keep you accountable.

## Conflict

When handling conflict, it’s important to stay objective and not immediately get defensive. Display willingness to learn from the conflict	try to understand the other person’s frustration. Use phrases like “I understand that my commit has angered you, can you elaborate”

Ask yourself if you really understand the position of the other person

Open discussion is not always possible if the meeting ends. In such a situation, it is important that you end the meeting in a co-operative mood. Use a phrase like “You made some good points today. Too bad we ran out of time. Let’s follow up on this tomorrow. I look forward to agreeing.”

## Complements

Don’t be hyperbolic or generic. Instead of saying “Thank you all for sharing these slides with me” pick out something generic like saying “I like how on slide three you’ve accurately covered the goals that our team is looking to achieve.” Instead of saying “That was a great meeting” say “Thank you for being considerate of time by keeping the meeting concise.”

## Emotional Intelligence

It is important to have blameless retrospectives in agile sprints so that we can say “We will believe that everyone has done their best with the information we had available. The point of this retrospective is to look back and see if we could’ve improved anything. 

## Self awareness

In order to become more self aware, it is important to be an objective evaluator of yourself. During a heated discussion, your reaction may be “I am angry” rather you should think “This situation is making me angry” Once you state that, you can analyze specifically what is making you angry. Is the other person not listening, are you not explaining correctly. After this negative experience, you can run a blameless postmortem on yourself and try to analyze what you could have differently. Be careful to not be impulsive and act solely based on emotion. It’s important to situations such as work to be able to act on reason and not solely on emotion.

## Motivation

You can maximize your goals effectively by following the smart model

* Specific: be specic with your goal. Focus on who what when where why and which. Ask yourself things like “Who is involved”  “What do you want to accomplish” “What is the purpose”
* Measurable. Focus on what the state of the situation should be at every step of the way. Ask yourself things like “How many” “How much” “What is the definition of done”. Establishing milestones will help to keep you on track and be able to celebrate and recalibrate at those milestones
* Attainable. Ask yourself if the goal is too ambitious or if it is even within reach
* Relevant. Avoid spending your focus in areas that have little to no relevance on the outcome of your goal. For example, it’d be great if I could customize my terminal to show my current branch and status but if it’s taking hours to get your terminal setup the way that you want it, you may want to abandon it as it’s only going to save you time it takes to run “git status” every couple hours
* Timely. A goal or even step of a goal with no deadline leads to procrastination

Goals can also follow a framework called PURE

* Positively Stated. Focus on the outcome you want to achieve rather than the things that you want to avoid. Focusing on what you want to avoid leads to self doubt which can be counter productive. 
* Understood. Make the goal well understood and as free from assumptions as possible. Clarity is especially essential in shared goals where vagueness may cause either a blocker or time spent in the wrong direction.
* Relevant. Is this a priority for the team or yourself to deal with? Are there more pressing issues that have a higher impact?
* Ethical. Do you believe in the goal? If you have doubt on the goal, you have risk due to inner conflict.

Goals can follow yet a third framework that is CLEAR

* Challenging. A goal needs to be the right level of Challenge and interesting to motivate you to keep working on it
* Legal. This applies more for corporate or commercial goals. Does it violate anything?
* Environmentally Sound. This doesn’t just apply to the environment but the environment is an example of something that people care about. For example, google has a goal to run on renewables not because of the business impact but because it’s a goal that people will rally around
* Agreed. Group goals need to have consensus from all active participants in order to maximize the output of the goal.
* Recorded. Stating the goal publicly whether to friends and family or through social media is an accountability partner.

It’s important to celebrate achievements and congratulate yourself along the way to keep the motivation going 

## Empathy

Much like self awareness is analyzing the emotions in yourself, empathy is the ability to recognize emotions in others. If you can understand the motivation and the feels of the person or people that you’re communicating with, you can more easily adapt your message. 

## Social Skills

In order to start getting along with someone, you need to pickup on their interests. Do they wear a special clothing accessory like a watch, t-shift, or sports jacket? Do you talk about one of their hobbies a lot? What kind of books or TV are they interested in. These can help to start a conversation so that you can build a relationship with the other person. Pay attention to specific details like the name of their kids or spouse to show that you take interest. These need to be genuine interest or else you will seem fake and unappealing. 

# Documents

Three forms of communication in this day and age: instant messaging, email, and documents. **instant messaging** is usually used for faster and more informal communication. **email** is relatively quick, maybe a response in a couple of hours and usually has its place as slightly more formal communication and ideal for threaded conversations between departments since you take advantage of distribution lists. **documents** are very formal communication that have the following structure:

* Title
   * Most important for finding a document. Apply some SEO tactics.
* Author
   * You should sign your name to your work since it represents your contributions and so that people know who to go to if they need further clarification
* Date
   * Technology in a company moves quickly so it's important to know the date of a document. Something written 3 years ago has less relevance than something written 1 month ago.
* Abstract
   * Every document should have a TLDR so that people have an idea of what they're about to read before investing time in reading it

Treat writing documents as an agile process just as software development. comments are code reviews.

While chats and emails are great forms of communication, you need to have design docs written up before project work begins. I've run into situations where stakeholders of a project will attempt to scope creep. This gives a contract to say the planned timeline for the given goals/scope. The design doc should be the following:

* Meta Data
   * In Addition to title and date, you should have the contributors, primary point of contact, and the approvers who've signed off on the project
* Context and scope
   * You should have a section that describes the project's goals and what is not in scope for the project
   * For example, the goal of safetbox is to transport files, rename them, have them scanned, and organized into galleryserver. What is not in scope is to have files merged
* Overview/Abstract
* Detailed design
   * High level overview of how we'll do this project.
   * We describe what APIs we'll be using, UI design (webpage/desktop), security/privacy.
   * This part of the design doc should still be kept concise
* Relationships to other systems
   * If other systems are already built in the organization that will take advantage of this
   * For example, I was on a project to build an integration between our ERP and another system. I built the api on the ERP.
* Alternatives
   * what else have we considered doing in this project? Why are we using this API? Why do we need to use this server?
   * This is important because it can prevent others from having this same question of why don't we do it like this.

Consider that the design doc has a wide audience from the stakeholders who care about outcomes to project managers who schedule resources to engineers who will be building step by step to devops who need to validate that the org can integrate the system infrastructure. Also consider that you may be talking to someone who's been at the company 10 years and understands the business or been there one week and has little idea of the business model still.

As with most software projects, things will change so it's worth making edits to the design doc, maybe even having weekly or biweekly meetings with the concerned parties so that everyone is on the same page.

It's ecspecially vital for an engineering team to have their own onboarding doc that will give the user a sort of bootcamp. It's vital that this will allow the new user to do something quickly like push something to production
