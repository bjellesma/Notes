## Chapter 3: Systems working well

Systems use a **hierarchy** to perform well and break up a 1000 moving parts in systems that each control a handful of parts. You need to give a subsytem a certain amount of autonomy without as much oversight to work well.

## Chapter 4: Why Systems surprise us

In a model, we're conditioned to think of a **linear relationship**, we can try a straight line on a graph between 2 points. If I lay 100lbs of fertalizer, my yield is 2lbs while if I lay 200lbs, my yield is 4lbs.
* Often in models, it's a **nonlinear relationship**, drawing a line between 2 data points results in a curved line. If I lay 100lbs of fertalizer, I get 2lbs of yield, if I lay 200lbs, my crops die (too much of a good thing)
* fossil feul emissions may not be reflected for a generation or two
* **bounded rationality** means that people make quite reasonable decisions based on the information they have but don't have perfect information. It's the reason why fisherman may fish a surplus of fish but, in the mean time, destroy their livlihoods. Fishermen don't now how many fish there are, much less how many fish will be caught by other fishermen that day.
