* 75% of all aluminum cans are still in use today which is kinda wild
* I didn't know that kelp absorbed so much carbon. I always just thought of it as the stuff that gets stuck to my leg
* Microsoft pledges to be carbon negative by 2030 which seems really ambitious
* Stripe introduced stripe climate to allow businesses to pay a small fee to help carbon capture technology
* What surprised me was how many young girls in India don't have access to basic education. I think that having at least a basic education for everyone is almost as important as having access to shots. It's a public good for everyone. Further education is more of a luxury tho
* The story on the sierra club was inspiring
* I don't understand the controversy of geoengineering. It seems necessary if possible
* google has always impressed me. Starting to buy renewables in 2007 was ambitious
* it really struck me when bezos said that we live better than our grandparents, we can't be the generation that breaks that
* I like how the author puts these new technologies in terms of economics because for a lot of people, that's the primary driver
* I remember watching a video before on how it doesn't make sense to keep using fossil fuels anyway because it's a finite resource, the switch to renewable energy makes more economic sense because it doesn't seem to have a limited supply
