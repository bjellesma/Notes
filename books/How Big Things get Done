Don’t fall into sunk cost fallacy
Be open to ideas of critics
Be inquisitive	 during the planning phase and ask probing questions such as why are you doing this
Paraphrasing Steve Jobs, he was saying that you’re selling customer experience, not technology. 
Jeff Bezos has a project at amazon first start with a PR piece and FAQ, typically an afterthought in many projects
Planning involves doing; making models and simulations
You need to aware of sidelining experience in favor of something else like politics or being the first or fastest
The benchmarks that we compare estimates to needs to be reasonable; has this type of work been done before
Use similar projects as an anchor to compare to when making estimates; like use the average cost of home renovation for old New York homes
A major idea in modern projects is the idea of modularity, to start a mega project build one piece so that it can start working and then build another piece exactly like it so that you can keep building that as you use the first piece. An example is the gigafactory in Nevada where it’s basically a few factories stuck together. Once one factory was finished, it could be used while the other was still being built
