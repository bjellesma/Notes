## Intro

* For most conspiracies, there is an element of truth
* Pizzagate asserted that Clinton, Lady Gaga, Tom Hanks, and others were members of a satantic cult operating out of the basement of a pizzaria
* people beleive such wild conspiracy theories because historically many have been true such as the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and Watergate. People also feel a sense of belonging and loyalty.
* From an evolutionary perspective, it was better to assume that the rustling in the grass was the a dangerous predator rather than the wind
* Conspiracies have been around forever but a landmark moment was the OJ simpson trial in which there was overwhelming evidence that he murdered his wife and best friend. Instead, the defence team used the general racism of the LAPD to claim falsely that the police planted evidence.


## Conspiracy and conspiracy theoriests

* There was a study that the more conspiracy theories that one believes in, the more likely the individual is to buy a gun
* This helps explain some groups such as the KKK which fears that Jews and other minories are seeking to replace whites in western culture, and Al-Quida and ISIS believes that America is seeking to wipe out Islam.

# A brief history

* people are more inclined to beleive conspiracy theories because they provide entertainment values
* highly educated people are actually more inclined to believe conspiracies if their group agrees because they're better at rationalizing counter evidence

## Constructive Conspiratism

* Claims of election interference harken back to 2000 (and probably earlier) when Bush beat Gore and democrats made claims of interference
* negative feeling suches as losses tend to feel twice as bad as winning. Tolstoy said that evil contaminates good more than good purifies evil.
* the author argues that the second law of thermodynamics is the first rule of life. Entropy is constantly happening and leading to disorder so life is constantly about fighting this disorder.
* the author argues that belief in conspiracy theories is evolutionary. millions of years ago if we heard a russle in the grass, it is far better to assume this is a predator and it turns out to be the wind than the other way around. It's more in our nature to assume a conspiracy theory is true rather than to assume that it's false

# How to determine which conspiracy theories are real

* There is a conspiracy theory that big pharma companies conspire together to sell people drugs that they don't need. We from the investigations of Purdue Pharma and the Sakler family as well as the opiod epidemic that this is true. Still, it doesn't mean that all big pharma is evvil
* Has the theory been verified by an external scientist. Real science requires validity from others in the scientific community and conspiracy theories typically lack these.
* Furthermore, conspiracy theories tend to either ignore contridictory evidence or invent more conspiracy to explain this
* another big difference is that real science starts with a null hypothosis and assumes that a claim is not true. For example, if you claim to develop a new drug for covid, businesses will start by assuming you do not have the drug until you can provide loads of evidence that your drug works. Conversely, conspiracies do not follow this null hypothesis. For example, UFO people cannot produce evidence that UFOs are real but expect you to beleive them based on what they say
* Scientists need to be willing to let go of their theories if they're presented with a better theory descibing anomolies that their theory doesn't account for. Conversely, conspiracy theorists will not be willing to let go of their theories
