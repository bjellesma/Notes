## Intro

* For most conspiracies, there is an element of truth
* Pizzagate asserted that Clinton, Lady Gaga, Tom Hanks, and others were members of a satantic cult operating out of the basement of a pizzaria
* people beleive such wild conspiracy theories because historically many have been true such as the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and Watergate. People also feel a sense of belonging and loyalty.
* From an evolutionary perspective, it was better to assume that the rustling in the grass was the a dangerous predator rather than the wind
* Conspiracies have been around forever but a landmark moment was the OJ simpson trial in which there was overwhelming evidence that he murdered his wife and best friend. Instead, the defence team used the general racism of the LAPD to claim falsely that the police planted evidence.


## Conspiracy and conspiracy theoriests

* There was a study that the more conspiracy theories that one believes in, the more likely the individual is to buy a gun
* This helps explain some groups such as the KKK which fears that Jews and other minories are seeking to replace whites in western culture, and Al-Quida and ISIS believes that America is seeking to wipe out Islam.
