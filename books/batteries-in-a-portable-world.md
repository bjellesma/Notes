# Crash Course on batteries

In 1800, Alessandro Volta, credited as the inventor of the battery, discovered that certain fluids would generate a continuous flow of electrical power when used as a conductor.

That same year, sir humphry Davy began testing the chemical effects of electricity and found that decomposition occured when passing electircal current through substances. This process was later called **electroloysis**.

Napolean actually participated in Volta's experiments in France.

In 1859, Gaston Plante invented the first rechargeable battery based on lead acid. Until this point, all batteries were primary meaning that they couldn't recharge.

in 1899, Waldmar Jungner from Sweden invented the nickle cadmium battery that used nickle as the positive electrode, **cathode**, and cadmium as the negative, **anode**. In 1901, Thomas Edison replaced cadmium with iron for the nickle iron battery. Unfortunatedly this had poor performance at low temperatures and , in 1932, focus was shifted back to the nickle cadmium battery as longevity was improved by inventing the sintered pole plate.

Nickle Cadmium batteries were used heavily until environmentalists became concerned about their carbon footprint. In 1991, Sony developed Lithium Ion (Li-ion) batteries.

## Electricity through Magnetism

In 1831, Michael Faraday demonstrated how a copper disc provided a constant flow of electricity when revolving in a strong magnetic field. He discovered that you could generate an endless electical force as long as the movement between a coil and a magnet continued. This lead to the invention of the electric generator. Faraday's work influenced Thomas Edison later who was able to invent the incandescent light bulb. Though Edison didn't invent the light bulb, he improved on earlier designs and achieved commercial viability.

Early electrical plants were only able to produce direct current which had a limitation of short distances. It was around 1886 when Nikola Tesla invented the alternating current trasmission system which enabled power plants to use AC to transmit electicity over longer distances.

The early inventors were split with Edison supporting direct current and claiming that alternating current has the danger of electocution while Tesla and Westinghouse supported alternating current as being the future of electicity. Eventually, alternating current won out and became the de facto standar.

Westinghouse famously demonstrated alternating current by lighting up the Chicago World's fair in 1893. 

The invention of the **electric vaccuum tube** in the early 1900s enabled signal amplifications leading to radio broadcasting in the 1920s and the first digital computer, the ENIAC, in 1946. The discovery of the transistor in 1947 led to the invention of the microprocessor which usher in the information age.

The electric vaccuum tube works by having the cathode at one end and the anode at the other. We heat the cathode so that the electrons essentially boil off and move toward the anode. This movement creates an electric current. In 1947, vaccuum tubes were largely replaced by transistors which were smaller and didn't require heat.

## Global Markets

In 2009, primary batteries still made up 23.6% of global markets. Though not rechargeable, these batteries have the advantage of a longer shelf life. These are the Duracell batteries that we buy at the convenience store. 

Though Li-ion batteries are the most common for portable devices, they're not the only game in town. For example, alkaline batteries have a higher energy density but are primary batteries whereas Li-ion are rechargeable.

primary batteries typically have the unique advantage of having much higher specific energy making it still have value in devices such as pacemakers which are designed to last 5-10 years.

## Potato Battery

A battery essentially turns chemical energy into electrical energy. A potato contains water and salt, which have the ions needed for an electrical reaction. If you add a zinc nail and a copper coin to the potato, the zinc nail will act as the anode (negative electrode), while the copper coin will act as the cathode (positive electrode). The chemical reaction at the zinc nail causes it to release electrons, which then flow through a wire to the copper coin. This flow of electrons generates an electric current, creating an electric charge.

The difference between the electrodes provides the terminal voltage. 

Multiplying the voltage by the current gives you power, which is measured in watts. The length of time a battery can deliver energy is expressed in watt-hours (Wh), which refers to the capacity of the battery. For example, a 30 GWh (gigawatt-hour) battery can deliver 1 kW of power for about 30,000 hours (since 1 GWh = 1,000,000 kWh, and 30 GWh = 30,000,000 kWh). So, a 30 GWh battery can power a 1 kW device for approximately 30,000 hours.

Batteries perform best at room temperatures. Cold temperatures slow the electrochemical reaction of batteries thus heating blankets are often added so that charging can still occur. High heat can also shorten battery life and compromise safety. 

The electrode of a battery that releases electrons during discharge is the anode while the electrode that absorbs the electrons is the cathode. During a charge cycle, this direction is reversed so that the anode will absorb electrons and store it in the battery. A battery also consists of an **electrolyte** which is what is used to fascilitate the passage of electrons. Let's take an example, when you're on your smartphone, the battery is actively discharging electrons in order to produce the current needed to run your phone. When the electrons flow, they move throughout the internal circuits of your phone, powering the electronics.

## Rechargeable Battery Types

Lead Acid - used for wheelchairs, golf carts, and uninteruptable power supplies.

Nickel Cadmium - Long service life, high discharge current, and extreme temperature resistence make this a good candidate for medical devices and aviation. However, these are less and less due to environmental concerns. The primary replacement is nickel metal hydride.

Lithium Ion - this is the most common type. It is typically more expensive but has a higher cycle count and lower maintenance requirement.

### C rating

This refers to how fast you're recommended to charge or discharge a battery relative to its capacity. If you have a 2400mAh battery and you're recommended to charge at 2400mA, this is 1C. A 2C rating would be 4800mA.

## Flooding a battery

When someone says that they flooded a battery, this means that they've overcharged it. The risk is that the electrolyte boils over and causes corrosion. This is more common with a lead acid battery and you don't run this same risk with your phone because your phone uses a lithium ion battery which don't flood. Your phone also has a battery management system which is smart enough to stop charging at 100% and just maintain that level.

## Lead Acid

Lead Acid batteries are still in use today even though they were invented in 1859. They are used in automotives for gasoline and diesel vehicles. They are also used in uninterruptable power supplies and fork lifts. They are cheap at about 1/3 the price of lithium alternatives. 

Depending on the depth of discharge, this battery type does have a smaller lifespan than alternatives.

* Discharged to 80% capacity: ~200-300 cycles
* Discharged to 50% capacity: ~500-800 cycles
* Discharged to 20% capacity: ~2,000+ cycles

### Sealed Lead Acid batteries

SLA Batteries most common application today is for use in battery backup systems and healthcare. They have a relatively short cycle lifecycle but this isn't a big deal since these batteries rarely cycle deeply.

## Starter Batteries

These are commonly used as an ignition because of its high power. Notably these batteries can be deep cycled but doing so will drastically shorten their lifespan but this isn't important because the battery is recharged while driving by the alternator.

Electric cars notably don't use a starter battery because there is no engine and therefore no alternator. Instead electric cars use regenerative braking to charge the lithium ion battery.

some cars and motorcycles use a newer type of starter battery called absorbent glass mat (agm) which offers the same performance but is lighter.

## Deep Cycle Batteries

These batteries are more common in wheelchairs and forklifts because they have high capacity and a reasonably high cycle count. The big reason that they're used in forklifts is because a forklift doesn't have an alternator to recharge the battery while charging.

## Eneloop

Eneloop are considered the gold standard of nickle metal hydride (NiMH) rechargables and is a trademark brand of panasonic.

Eneloop has also had luck in reducing the self discharge. self discharge refers to leaving a battery in a drawer for a couple of weeks and it gradually losing charge over time.

## Nickle Hydrogen

These batteries are used mostly for satalites due to their resistance to temperatures. This is still used in the hubble and was used for a long time on the ISS before being replaced with more modern lithium ion batteries.

## Lithium Batteries

Lithium is the lightest of all metals, has the greatest electrochemical potential, and provides the largest specific energy per weight. Though research using lithium metal didn't succeed, research shifted toward **Lithium Ion**. The biggest disadvantage with lithium ion is that it is lower in specific energy but this is generally ok because the voltage and current limits are about the same. Much of this research is credited to **John B Goodenough**

### Lithium Cobalt Oxide

Popular for mobile phones and video cameras due to its high energy density, allowing for compact, lightweight batteries. However, it has safety concerns with overheating and is more expensive than other lithium-ion chemistries.

### Lithium Phosphate

These batteries are starting to be used to replace lead based starter batteries in vehicles. Lithium Phosphate offers better performance, costs less and weights
