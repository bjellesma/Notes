# Crash Course on batteries

In 1800, Alessandro Volta, credited as the inventor of the battery, discovered that certain fluids would generate a continuous flow of electrical power when used as a conductor.

That same year, sir humphry Davy began testing the chemical effects of electricity and found that decomposition occured when passing electircal current through substances. This process was later called **electroloysis**.

Napolean actually participated in Volta's experiments in France.

In 1859, Gaston Plante invented the first rechargeable battery based on lead acid. Until this point, all batteries were primary meaning that they couldn't recharge.

in 1899, Waldmar Jungner from Sweden invented the nickle cadmium battery that used nickle as the positive electrode, **cathode**, and cadmium as the negative, **anode**. In 1901, Thomas Edison replaced cadmium with iron for the nickle iron battery. Unfortunatedly this had poor performance at low temperatures and , in 1932, focus was shifted back to the nickle cadmium battery as longevity was improved by inventing the sintered pole plate.

Nickle Cadmium batteries were used heavily until environmentalists became concerned about their carbon footprint. In 1991, Sony developed Lithium Ion (Li-ion) batteries.

## Electricity through Magnetism

In 1831, Michael Faraday demonstrated how a copper disc provided a constant flow of electricity when revolving in a strong magnetic field. He discovered that you could generate an endless electical force as long as the movement between a coil and a magnet continued. This lead to the invention of the electric generator. Faraday's work influenced Thomas Edison later who was able to invent the incandescent light bulb. Though Edison didn't invent the light bulb, he improved on earlier designs and achieved commercial viability.

Early electrical plants were only able to produce direct current which had a limitation of short distances. It was around 1886 when Nikola Tesla invented the alternating current trasmission system which enabled power plants to use AC to transmit electicity over longer distances.

The early inventors were split with Edison supporting direct current and claiming that alternating current has the danger of electocution while Tesla and Westinghouse supported alternating current as being the future of electicity. Eventually, alternating current won out and became the de facto standar.

Westinghouse famously demonstrated alternating current by lighting up the Chicago World's fair in 1893. 

The invention of the **electric vaccuum tube** in the early 1900s enabled signal amplifications leading to radio broadcasting in the 1920s and the first digital computer, the ENIAC, in 1946. The discovery of the transistor in 1947 led to the invention of the microprocessor which usher in the information age.

The electric vaccuum tube works by having the cathode at one end and the anode at the other. We heat the cathode so that the electrons essentially boil off and move toward the anode. This movement creates an electric current. In 1947, vaccuum tubes were largely replaced by transistors which were smaller and didn't require heat.

## Global Markets

In 2009, primary batteries still made up 23.6% of global markets. Though not rechargeable, these batteries have the advantage of a longer shelf life. These are the Duracell batteries that we buy at the convenience store. 

Though Li-ion batteries are the most common for portable devices, they're not the only game in town. For example, alkaline batteries have a higher energy density but are primary batteries whereas Li-ion are rechargeable.

primary batteries typically have the unique advantage of having much higher specific energy making it still have value in devices such as pacemakers which are designed to last 5-10 years.

## Potato Battery

A battery essentially turns chemical energy into electrical energy. A potato contains water and salt, which have the ions needed for an electrical reaction. If you add a zinc nail and a copper coin to the potato, the zinc nail will act as the anode (negative electrode), while the copper coin will act as the cathode (positive electrode). The chemical reaction at the zinc nail causes it to release electrons, which then flow through a wire to the copper coin. This flow of electrons generates an electric current, creating an electric charge.

The difference between the electrodes provides the terminal voltage. 

Multiplying the voltage by the current gives you power, which is measured in watts. The length of time a battery can deliver energy is expressed in watt-hours (Wh), which refers to the capacity of the battery. For example, a 30 GWh (gigawatt-hour) battery can deliver 1 kW of power for about 30,000 hours (since 1 GWh = 1,000,000 kWh, and 30 GWh = 30,000,000 kWh). So, a 30 GWh battery can power a 1 kW device for approximately 30,000 hours.

Batteries perform best at room temperatures. Cold temperatures slow the electrochemical reaction of batteries thus heating blankets are often added so that charging can still occur. High heat can also shorten battery life and compromise safety. 

The electrode of a battery that releases electrons during discharge is the anode while the electrode that absorbs the electrons is the cathode. During a charge cycle, this direction is reversed so that the anode will absorb electrons and store it in the battery. A battery also consists of an **electrolyte** which is what is used to fascilitate the passage of electrons. Let's take an example, when you're on your smartphone, the battery is actively discharging electrons in order to produce the current needed to run your phone. When the electrons flow, they move throughout the internal circuits of your phone, powering the electronics.

## Rechargeable Battery Types

Lead Acid - used for wheelchairs, golf carts, and uninteruptable power supplies.

Nickel Cadmium - Long service life, high discharge current, and extreme temperature resistence make this a good candidate for medical devices and aviation. However, these are less and less due to environmental concerns. The primary replacement is nickel metal hydride.

Lithium Ion - this is the most common type. It is typically more expensive but has a higher cycle count and lower maintenance requirement.

# Chapter 2 - Battery Types

### C rating

This refers to how fast you're recommended to charge or discharge a battery relative to its capacity. If you have a 2400mAh battery and you're recommended to charge at 2400mA, this is 1C. A 2C rating would be 4800mA.

## Flooding a battery

When someone says that they flooded a battery, this means that they've overcharged it. The risk is that the electrolyte boils over and causes corrosion. This is more common with a lead acid battery and you don't run this same risk with your phone because your phone uses a lithium ion battery which don't flood. Your phone also has a battery management system which is smart enough to stop charging at 100% and just maintain that level.

## Lead Acid

Lead Acid batteries are still in use today even though they were invented in 1859. They are used in automotives for gasoline and diesel vehicles. They are also used in uninterruptable power supplies and fork lifts. They are cheap at about 1/3 the price of lithium alternatives. 

Depending on the depth of discharge, this battery type does have a smaller lifespan than alternatives.

* Discharged to 80% capacity: ~200-300 cycles
* Discharged to 50% capacity: ~500-800 cycles
* Discharged to 20% capacity: ~2,000+ cycles

### Sealed Lead Acid batteries

SLA Batteries most common application today is for use in battery backup systems and healthcare. They have a relatively short cycle lifecycle but this isn't a big deal since these batteries rarely cycle deeply.

## Starter Batteries

These are commonly used as an ignition because of its high power. Notably these batteries can be deep cycled but doing so will drastically shorten their lifespan but this isn't important because the battery is recharged while driving by the alternator.

Electric cars notably don't use a starter battery because there is no engine and therefore no alternator. Instead electric cars use regenerative braking to charge the lithium ion battery.

some cars and motorcycles use a newer type of starter battery called absorbent glass mat (agm) which offers the same performance but is lighter.

## Deep Cycle Batteries

These batteries are more common in wheelchairs and forklifts because they have high capacity and a reasonably high cycle count. The big reason that they're used in forklifts is because a forklift doesn't have an alternator to recharge the battery while charging.

## Eneloop

Eneloop are considered the gold standard of nickle metal hydride (NiMH) rechargables and is a trademark brand of panasonic.

Eneloop has also had luck in reducing the self discharge. self discharge refers to leaving a battery in a drawer for a couple of weeks and it gradually losing charge over time.

## Nickle Hydrogen

These batteries are used mostly for satalites due to their resistance to temperatures. This is still used in the hubble and was used for a long time on the ISS before being replaced with more modern lithium ion batteries.

## Lithium Batteries

Lithium is the lightest of all metals, has the greatest electrochemical potential, and provides the largest specific energy per weight. Though research using lithium metal didn't succeed, research shifted toward **Lithium Ion**. The biggest disadvantage with lithium ion is that it is lower in specific energy but this is generally ok because the voltage and current limits are about the same. Much of this research is credited to **John B Goodenough**

### Lithium Cobalt Oxide

Popular for mobile phones and video cameras due to its high energy density, allowing for compact, lightweight batteries. However, it has safety concerns with overheating and is more expensive than other lithium-ion chemistries.

### Lithium Phosphate

These batteries are starting to be used to replace lead based starter batteries in vehicles. Lithium Phosphate offers better performance, costs less and weights

## Cycling Performance

Nickel Cadmium batteries are the most life cycling endurance. In testing, these were cycled at 100% depth of discharge for over 2300 cycles with near perfect performance. These remain the prefered choich for aircrafts.

Nickel Metal Hydride offered high specific energy but loses capacity after the 300 cycle mark. There was also a rise in self discharge after the 1000 cycle mark. 

### Supercapacitors

A capacitor stores energy by means of static charge as opposed to an electrochemical reaction. Capacitors are measured in Farad which is a unit named after Michael Faraday. One farad stores one coulomb of electrical charge when applying one volt. A coulomb is the basic unit of electrical charge - think of it like a "bucket" of electrons. 1 coulomb = the charge of about 6.24 × 10¹⁸ electrons. 1 amp = 1 coulomb flowing past a point per second. So if 2 amps flows for 3 seconds, that's 6 coulombs of charge.

Though supercapacitors are very different than batteries as they store electricity in electric fields rather than chemical reactions like you see in batteries, they're often considered as candidates to replace batteries in certain applications. The big advantage with supercapacitors is that they are a lot faster to charge. The big disadvantage is energy density in that these store a lot less energy than typical batteries. For example, a supercapacitor isn't used in a mobile phone because the energy density is very low.

However, supercapacitors do have their own applications in systems like regenerative braking (typically this is more useful in comercial vehicles like electric busses whereas passenger cars do just fine using the lithium ion battery for this) and UPS backup power, where they provide quick bursts of energy while batteries handle longer-term storage.

Given this energy density constraint, there is a lot of research into high capacity supercapacitors as this would be revolutionary in the energy storage domain. However, this still needs about 10-20x more density to be competive to batteries.

### internal resistance

Resistance slows down the flow of electrons within the battery, causing voltage drops under load and energy loss as heat. This increases gradually with age and varies depending on the battery chemistry type.

### Coulomb counting

Coulomb counting is a method to track how much charge goes into and out of a battery to estimate its state of charge. 

Example:

Battery capacity: 2400mAh (2.4 amp-hours)
Currently 50% charged = 1200mAh remaining
Device draws 200mA for 1 hour = 200mAh used
New state: 1200 - 200 = 1000mAh remaining (about 42%)

Where you see it:

Battery management systems (BMS)
Electric car "fuel gauges"
Laptop battery meters
Smartphone battery percentage

### Fuel Cells

These are an alectrochemical device that combines hydrogen fuel with oxygen to produce electricity, heat, and water.

The fuel cell is 2x as efficient as combustion and is clean. This would theoretically be unlimited as hydrogen is the most abundant element on Earth. The fuel cell was invented back in 1839 but never took off because this was during the time of development of the internal combustion engine which was showing more promising results. Fuel cells did have a resurgance in the 1960s with the gemani space program which prefered this source as opposed to nuclear and solar. 

Though alkaline fuel cells were used in aerospace for a long time, modern aerospace uses Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells which have higher power density and specific energy.

Fuel cells are more flammable than batteries due to hydrogen and more expensive.

### Flow Batteries

These are a cross between a conventional battery and a fuel cell. Flow batteries store energy in liquid electrolytes contained in external tanks, with energy capacity determined by tank size and power output determined by the electrochemical cell stack. They offer very long discharge durations (4-12+ hours), excellent cycle life, and easy scalability, making them ideal for grid-scale energy storage, though they have lower energy density than lithium-ion batteries.

The main trade-off is they're bulky and complex compared to lithium-ion, but perfect for stationary applications where space isn't as critical as long-term reliability.

Flow Batteries are much more mature than supercapacitors and fuel cells and already compete with conventional batteries for grid storage. They pose an advantage of have a lower fabrication cost due to less rare minerals. 

## Future Batteries

Sodium Ion batteries are being looked at because sodium is much more inexpensive than lithium and can be completly discharged without encountering stresses common with other batteries.

A solid-state battery (SSB) is an electrical battery that uses a solid electrolyte (solectro) to conduct ions between the electrodes, instead of the liquid or gel polymer electrolytes found in conventional batteries. The advantages are higher energy density, faster charging, and enhanced safety (solid electrolyte is less flammible). The current challenge of solid-state batteries is implementation and scale-up, rather than getting something even better at the cell level.

It's not a technology problem anymore - it's an engineering and manufacturing problem:

How do you make millions of them reliably?
How do you drive costs down to compete with lithium-ion?
How do you build the supply chains and factory infrastructure?

# Chapter 3 - Packaging and Safety

## Cylindrical Cells

These are the most common format of batteries that you'll buy at the store. You'll also see these in electric vehicles, laptops, and power tools

The formulation of naming schemes like AA and AAA and AAAA are a result of us running out of naming schemes. Electric vehicles may even, for example, use a battery size called 18650 which is named for the first two digits representing the diameter in millimeters and the next three digits are the length in tenths of millimeters. In this case the battery is 18 mm in diameter and 65.0 mm in length.

Here's a cross section of a typical lithium ion battery. Notice that there's a release vent that connects to a fuse that will permanently open if an unsafe pressure builds up.

<img width="210" height="241" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e743d22f-8bbb-43f1-ae96-902750a9cc13" />

Cylindrical cells are often space apart to stop propogation in the case of a cell disintegrating. This also helps in thermal management.

## Button Cells

These are the coin shaped watch batteries. These have largely fallen out of favor due to them not being rechargeable and not having a venting mechanism.

## Prismatic Cells

The cells were introduced in the 1990s and satisfies the demand for thinner sizes. These are primarily used in mobile phones, tablets, and low profile laptops. 

This format can take advantage of a layered approach so that we can stack these.

<img width="500" height="406" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09b0bc8c-bf87-47fb-8833-5c04ee7d87d0" />

## Pouch Cells

Pouch Cells were first developed in 1995 and look kind of like a primatic cell in that the design is very good for packaging efficiency. These are commonly used in portable applications requiring high current load such as drones and hobby gadgets.

<img width="1000" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86c28df8-fbd0-4525-93b8-dd09cef282ed" />

These cells have a risk of swelling and therefor should not be stacked but instead be laid side by side. Swelling of 8-10% over 500 cycles should be considered. The following is an image of a swelled battery.

<img width="245" height="206" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa3d7d3b-e84d-4114-8c38-b9f9654f1c97" />

## Series Connection

Many applications requiring higher voltages will connect batteries in series. The current will remain the same as long as the current on all of the batteries used in series is the same. In the example image below, we're connecting two 12v batteries to get 24v. If the application requires 23V, using 24V may work since some devices can tolerate small amounts of overvoltage (typically 5-10%), but check the device specifications first as overvoltage can damage sensitive electronics. All batteries in series should be the same type, capacity, and condition as mixing batteries can be dangerous.

<img width="1237" height="621" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68b09931-024d-41b2-b767-cb2d3654bb05" />

With multiple cells connected in a string, the possibility of one cell failing is real and this would cause a failure. to prevent this from happening, a solid state switch is some large packs bypasses the failing cell to allow continued current flow, albeing at a lower string voltage.

## Parallel Connections

Conversely, you'll also be able to specify a parallel connection if the voltage can remain the same but we want to add the currents.

<img width="1024" height="922" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/374d02cf-98ef-4ea1-94ad-2c268a7a9817" />

It is possible to combine series and parallel connections to obtain the desired voltage and current. However, the battery management system (BMS) must be very sophisticated as all batteries must stay at the same capacity. The Tesla Model S is said to have over 7000 18650 batteries running this way. 

EVs absolutely require sophisticated monitoring because the scale (thousands of cells) and the power levels (hundreds of kilowatts) make manual monitoring impossible and the consequences of imbalance potentially catastrophic.

## Safety Notes

Series is generally more fire-prone due to higher voltages, but both configurations are dangerous if batteries are mismatched. The key safety rule for both: always use batteries of the same type, age, and charge level. This is good advice for home use. If one battery in your device is weak, you should replace all of them at once.

This is why you see warnings on battery packages about not mixing old and new batteries, or different battery types (alkaline vs rechargeable) - the mismatch creates safety risks.

The most basic safety device in a battery is a fuse that opens on high current. Some of these fuses will open permanently and render the battery useless while others will reset. **Power Thermal Coefficients** is a resetable device that can reset once the problem is removed. They're built into a battery cell or pack when manufactured.

While not the only cause, faulty seperators in batteries from aging, rough handline, or excessive vibration are a major cause of battery fires. These are common in lithium ion batteries because they have more energy density and thinner seperators. A BMS can help to detect faulty seperators by monitoring symptoms. The following are some symptoms:

Voltage irregularities - cells with separator damage show abnormal voltage behavior
Temperature spikes - separator failure causes rapid heating
Internal resistance changes - damaged separators alter cell resistance
Self-discharge rates - cells with separator issues discharge faster when idle
Cell imbalance - damaged cells fall out of sync with healthy ones

Lithium Metal also requires a class d fire extinguisher

## Confusion with Voltages

A battery is an electrochemical device that produces a voltage potential when placing metels of different affinities into an acid solution (electrolyte). The **Open Circuit Voltage** (OCV) that develops as part of an electrochemical reaction varies with the metals and electorlyte used. Applying a charge or discharge places the battery into the **Closed Circuit Voltage** (CCV) condition. Charging raises the voltage and discharging lowers it. Temperature also plays a role. A cold temperature lowers the voltage and heat raises it.

## Battery Seperator

Battery Seperators in an insulator that seperates the cathode and annode. Some current is lost on each pass through the seperator and this is refered to as **self discharge** and eventually wears out the battery ecspecially during prolonged storage. On excessive heat, a shutdown occurs by closing the pores of the lithium ion seperator through a melting process. The polyethelene seperator melts at 266 F effectively shutting down the transport of ions and the battery. Must batteries for modbile phones and tablets use a single seperator whereas large industrial batteries have three layers of seperators.

The nominal voltage is given by manufacturers. 

| Battery | Nominal Voltage |
------
| Lead Acid | 2 volts per cell |
| Nickle Based | 1.2 volts per cell |
| Lithium Ion | 3.6 volts per cell |

## Availability

Shortages could arise if everyone starts to drive electric vehicles

<img width="243" height="208" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3da16cd7-a230-4ba1-ba6f-2901808b7df1" />

## Graphene

Graphene is available but not yet at the scale needed for widespread commercial battery use. The reality is much more nuanced than the hype suggests:
Current graphene availability:

Small quantities for research and specialized applications
Expensive - costs thousands of dollars per kilogram
Production methods exist but aren't scalable for mass battery production
Quality varies widely between different production methods

Why graphene batteries aren't here yet:
Manufacturing challenges:

No cost-effective mass production method developed
Quality control - hard to get consistent, high-quality graphene at scale
Integration problems - difficult to incorporate into existing battery manufacturing

Technical limitations:

Pure graphene is actually not ideal for batteries (it's too conductive)
Needs modification to work properly in battery applications
Long-term stability issues still being researched

Current status:

Research stage - lots of promising lab results
Some hybrid approaches - adding small amounts of graphene to improve existing batteries
Marketing hype - many "graphene battery" claims are exaggerated

What's actually happening:

Graphene-enhanced batteries - small amounts added to silicon anodes or other components
Supercapacitor applications - more promising near-term use for graphene
Timeline realistic estimate: 10-20 years for true graphene batteries

The pattern:
This is similar to other "revolutionary" battery technologies - the science is promising, but the engineering and manufacturing challenges are enormous. We've been "5 years away" from graphene batteries for about 15 years now.
Bottom line: Graphene is real and has amazing properties, but commercial graphene batteries remain in the "promising research" category rather than imminent reality.
