# Intro

**Supervised Learning** can be thought of a teacher showing pictures of houses and bikes to a kindagardener and the kid starts to learning that the houses have sharper edges whereas bikes are more rounded edges. In this example, we're using **labeled** data. **Unsupervised Learning** can be thought as just seeing these things through daily experience and recognizing patterns. This means that unsupervised learning can be a good preprocesser for supervised learning.
