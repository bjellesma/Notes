# Token Classification

This is generic task for attributing a label to each token in a sentence. This can be used for tasks such as

* Named entity recognition (NER): Find the entities (such as persons, locations, or organizations) in a sentence. This can be formulated as attributing a label to each token by having one class per entity and one class for “no entity.”
* Part-of-speech tagging (POS): Mark each word in a sentence as corresponding to a particular part of speech (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.).
