**Tokamaks** are the champion in the fusion space. 80-90% of work nowadays is done on a tokamak. Giant racetrack for plasma. As it goes around, it's heated by electric and magnetic fields.

Russia initially build this while America was working on pinches and the Stellerator.

The difference is that stellerators are twisted rings and tokamaks are not twisted. 

**Spherical Tokamaks** are shaped like an apple core and have different physics because of their shape. While regular tokamaks are shaped like Donuts. Since stellerators are twisted, the plasma scattering effect is keeping plasma in the center.

The world's most famous stellerorator is the w7x in germany in 2017-2018. The goal is to get this to a runtime of 30 minutes.

In theory, superconducting tokamaks can run forever until they reach some quench event.
