**Fission** splits a larger atom into 2 or more smaller ones

**Fusion** joins 2 or more lighter atoms into a larger one. They need to be within 2 femtometers ($2^{-16}$). This causes a quantum tunelling effect.

You have three main fueling options for fusion:

* Deuterium + Deuritium
    * Cheaper
* Deuterium + Tritium
    * Much higher yield.   
    * More Expensive
    * 12.5 year half life
    * Tritium does have a radioactive decay
* Boron-11 + Proton
    * 15x times hotter temperature required
        * Often infesible
    * Small radioactive waste

Your net power is measured the following:

$\text{Net Power} = (\text{Fusion Rate} - \text{Conduction} - \text{Radiation}) * \text{Efficiency}$

**Conduction Loss**: Mass leaving the reactor

**Radiation Loss**: Light removing energy from reactor

**Fusion Rate**: How fast plasma makes fusion energy.

**Efficiency**: How well the machine works

# Commercial Applications of Fusion

Medical Isotopes - A company called shine imaging uses fusion reactions to generate neutrons.

Fusion Rockets - Because of the efficiency of the exhaust plume running at a percentage of the speed of light, you can get to Mars in 30 days. There are a couple of companies looking into this.
