* A **Framework** is basically the math equations and assumptions that you can use to model the plasma physics
* Dr. Rosenbluth is known as the pope of plasma physics
* Most companies will outsource the creation of the modeling software

## Excel Modeling

* Find the field strength
* Find the Lorenz Force
* Apply Newtons Laws of Motion
* Take a time step
* Repeat

## Vlasov Equation

* 2 Equations for fluid motion
* 4 of Maxwell's equation to describe electric fields and magnatism

## Particle in Cell (PIC)

* Frank Harlow pioneered this
* Particles move from cell to cell and a different processor might take over

## Quantum Field Theory

* Plasma sits in a web of forces
* Lagrange equations
    * Great for describing equations
