A **plasmoid** is a loop of plasma going in a circle. The magetic field attempts to stabilize the electrical properties of plasma.

Plasma structures naturally break apart so everyone in this space is trying to keep them stable. For example, Princeton is using current to attempt to stablize plasma

an **FRC** is a field reverse configuration and means that the field inside of a tokamak is reversing direction.

The idea behind fusion rockets is you take a plasmoid or plasma, put it through a magnetic nozzle, and that compresses the plasma to higher densities and higher temperatures which unleash more fusion events. The plasma then leaves the ship as exhaust and pushes the ship forward.
