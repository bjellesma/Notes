1. Which of the following is equivalent to $\neg \forall x[P(x) \Rightarrow (Q(x) \vee R(x))]¬∀x[P(x)⇒(Q(x)∨R(x))]$? (Only one is.) [5 points]


$ \exists x[P(x) \land (\neg Q(x) \wedge \neg R(x))]$


2. Let p,q be variables denoting tennis players, let t be a variable denoting games of tennis, and let W(p,q,t) mean that p plays against q in game tt and wins. Which of the following claims about tennis players mean the same as the symbolic formula $\forall p \exists q \exists t W(p,q,t)$? Select all that have that meaning. [5 points]

for all players there exists another player in a game such that all players can beat another player

Everyone wins a game.

For every player there is another player they beat all the time.

There is a player who loses every game.

There is a player who wins every game.


3. Let p,q be variables denoting the tennis players in a club, let t be a variable denoting the club's games of tennis, and let W(p,q,t) mean that p plays against q in game t and wins. Assuming that there are at least two tennis players and games between them do take place, which (if any) of the following symbolic formula cannot possibly be true? Select all you think cannot possibly be true. [3 points]

$\forall p \exists q \exists t W(p,q,t)$

for all players, there exists another player and there exists a game where they beat that player

$\forall p \forall q \exists t W(p,q,t)$

This doesn't make sense

$\forall q \exists p \exists t W(p,q,t))$

for all players, there is another player where for every game they win


4. Which (one) of the following means "Everybody loves a lover", where L(x,y) means (person) x loves (person) y and a lover is defined to be someone in a mutual loving relationship? [5 points] If English is not your native language, you might want to discuss this sentence with a native English speaker before you answer. It's an idiomatic expression.]

\forall x [\exists z(L(x,z) \wedge L(z,x)) \wedge \forall y L(y,x)]∀x[∃z(L(x,z)∧L(z,x))∧∀yL(y,x)]


5. Which of the following statements about the order relation on the real line is/are false? [4 points]

$\forall x \forall y \forall z[(x \leq y) \wedge (y \leq z) \Rightarrow (x \leq z)]$

for all numbers, if x is less than or equal to y and y is less than or equal to z, then x is less than z

True

$\forall x \forall y [(x \leq y) \wedge (y \leq x) \Rightarrow (x = y)]$

for all numbers where x is less than or equal to y and y is less than or equal to x, x must be equal to y

True

$\forall x \exists y [(x \leq y) \wedge (y \leq x)]$

for all numbers, there exists another number where x is less than or equal to y and y is less than or equal to x

False, only for zero is there another number that is equal to

$\exists x \forall y [(y \lt x) \vee (x \lt y)]$

There exists a number x for every number y where y is less than x or x is less than y

False. What is the two numbers are the same.

6. Evaluate this purported proof, and grade it according to the course rubric.
Claim: If an integer N is divisible by a prime p, then n+1 is not disible by P.

Proof: Suppose N is divisible by P. then there is an integer q such that n=pq. so n+1=pq+1. then

$\frac{n+1}{p} = q + \frac{1}{p}$

but $q + \frac{1}{p}$ is not an integer so N+1 is not divisible by p.
