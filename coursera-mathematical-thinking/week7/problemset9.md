1. True or False
    1. 20|300 is true
    2. 17|35 is false
    3. 5|0 is true because $\exists q[0=5q]$
    4. 0|5 is false because 0 can't be the divisor
    5. 21|-21 is true because $\exists q[-21=21q]$

2. Theorem: The square of any odd number is 1 more than a multiple of 8. The proof givin is invalid because you're not giving a rigorous proof.

TODO: This is incorrect

3. This is an invalid proof because we're saying that m is the least number and then we're saying that it's greater than 1.

TODO: This is incorrect


4. 19 The proof is valid and only lacking in the criteria of the induction hypothesis
5. 16 The theorem is false but has several mathematical merits
