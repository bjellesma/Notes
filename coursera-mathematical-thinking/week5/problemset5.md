1. Let m, n denote any two natural numbers. Is the following a valid proof that mn is odd iff m and
n are odd?
If m, n are odd there are integers p, q such that m = 2p+1, n = 2q+1. Then mn = (2p+1)(2q+1) =
2(2pq + p + q) + 1, so mn is odd. That completes the proof.

No, you need to prove implication the other way. The other side you need to prove is if mn is odd, are m and n odd?


INCORRECT 2. Take the sentence:
You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all the time.
Let x be a variable for a person, t a variable for a period of time, and let F(x, t) mean you can fool
x at time t. Which of the following mathematical formulas is equivalent to the given statement?
(a) ∃x∃tF(x, t) ∧ ∃x∃t¬F(x, t)
(b) ∃x∃tF(x, t) ∧ ¬∀x∃tF(x, t)
(c) ∃x∃tF(x, t) ∧ ¬∃x∃tF(x, t)
(d) None of the above.

C. Negation of existence is the same as the universal quantifier

3. True or false? For any two statements φ and ψ, either φ ⇒ ψ or its converse is true (or both).

True. Look at the truth tables

4. Are the following two statements equivalent? ¬(φ ⇒ ψ) and φ ∧ (¬ψ)

True because ¬(φ ⇒ ψ) = $\phi \not \implies \psi$. We proved this equivalence in week4

INCORRECT 5. Are the following two statements equivalent? (φ ∨ ψ) ⇒ θ and (φ ⇒ θ) ∧ (ψ ⇒ θ)

| $\phi$ | $\psi$ | $\theta$ | (φ ∨ ψ) ⇒ θ | (φ ⇒ θ) ∧ (ψ ⇒ θ)
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T | T | T |
| T | T | F | F | T |

False

6. True or false? There are infinitely many natural numbers n for which √n is rational. (Before
entering your answer, you should construct a proof of the statement or its negation, so you are
sure.)

True.

This is the list of squares, which in infinite, I don't undersand the proof

7. This argument is a proof that 1 = 2. Obviously it is incorrect. Identify exactly what the error is,
and grade the purported proof according to the course rubric. (Remember, this is not a regular
mathematics course of the kind you are probably familiar with. We are working on various elements
of mathematical thinking, mathematical exposition, and the communication of mathematics. The
rubric is designed to focus attention on all of those factors.) Your ”Overall valuation” figure is the
grade you would assign a student if s/he submitted this proof in a first-year college mathematics
course.
Argument to show that 1 = 2.
We start with the identity
1 − 3 = 4 − 6
Adding 9
4
to both sides to complete the squares, we get
1 − 3 + 9
4 = 4 − 6 + 9
4
This factors as
(1 −
3
2
)
2 = (2 −
3
2
)
2
Taking the square root of both sides,
1 −
3
2 = 2 −
3
2
Hence
1 = 2
