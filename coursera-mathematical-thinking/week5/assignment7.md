1. Prove or disprove the statement “All birds can fly.”

Let A be animals, let b be bird

$\forall b \in A$

2. Prove or disprove the claim (∀x, y ∈ R)[(x − y)^2 > 0].

$(x-y)^2$ must be positive because any number squared is positive. We know that any squared number is positive. Unless x and y are the same number, the theorem will be true

3. Prove that between any two unequal rationals there is a third rational.

Let m and n be rational. If we assume r is irrational then $\frac{p}{q} < r < \frac{s}{t}$

contrapositive?

4. Explain why proving φ ⇒ ψ and ψ ⇒ φ establishes the truth of φ ⇔ ψ.

This proves implication is both directions

5. Explain why proving φ ⇒ ψ and (¬φ) ⇒ (¬ψ) establishes the truth of φ ⇔ ψ.

(¬φ) ⇒ (¬ψ) is a contapositive of $\psi \implies \phi$

6. Prove that if five investors split a payout of $2M, at least one investor receives at least $400,000.

$\exists i \in I (p\ge 400000)$

The assumption the no amount of investors receive at least 400000 doesn't make sense because the payout is 2M

7. Prove that √3 is irrational.

Assume $\sqrt{3}$ is rational. Then there are natural numbers p, q with no common factors, such that $\sqrt{3}=\frac{p}{q}$. 

Squaring: $3=\frac{p^2}{q^2}$

Rearranging: $3q^2 = p^2$ or $p=\sqrt{3}q$ and $q=\frac{p}{\sqrt{3}}$

?

If p is natural number and root 3 is rational, then q must be rational.

8. Write down the converses of the following conditional statements:
(a) If the Dollar falls, the Yuan will rise.
(b) If x < y then −y < −x. (For x, y real numbers.)
(c) If two triangles are congruent they have the same area.
(d) The quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has a solution whenever b
2 ≥ 4ac. (Where a, b, c, x
denote real numbers and a 6= 0.)
(e) Let ABCD be a quadrilateral. If the opposite sides of ABCD are pairwise equal, then the
opposite angles are pairwise equal.
(f) Let ABCD be a quadrilateral. If all four sides of ABCD are equal, then all four angles are
equal.
(g) If n is not divisible by 3 then n
2 + 5 is divisible by 3. (For n a natural number.)
9. Discounting the first example, which of the statements in the previous question are true, for which
is the converse true, and which are equivalent? Prove your answers.
10. Prove or disprove the statement “An integer n is divisible by 12 if and only if n
3
is divisible by 12.”
11. Let r, s be irrationals. For each of the following, say whether the given number is necessarily
irrational, and prove your answer. (The last one is tricky to do by elementary means. I’ll give a
solution in Lecture 8, but you should definitely try it first. Give it half an hour of focused thought.)
1. r + 3 2. 5r 3. r + s
4. rs 5.
√
r 6. rs
12. Let m and n be integers. Prove that:
(a) If m and n are even, then m + n is even.
(b) If m and n are even, then mn is divisible by 4.
(c) If m and n are odd, then m + n is even.
(d) If one of m, n is even and the other is odd, then m + n is odd.
(e) If one of m, n is even and the other is odd, then mn is even.
