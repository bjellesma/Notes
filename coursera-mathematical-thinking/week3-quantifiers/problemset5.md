3. Which of the following formal propositions says that there is no largest prime. (There may be more
than one. You have to select all correct propositions.) The variables denote natural numbers.
(a) ¬∃x∃y[Prime(x) ∧ ¬Prime(y) ∧ (x < y)]
(b) ∀x∃y[Prime(x) ∧Prime(y) ∧ (x < y)]
(c) ∀x∀y[Prime(x) ∧Prime(y) ∧ (x < y)]
(d) ∀x∃y[Prime(y) ∧ (x < y)]
(e) ∃x∀y[Prime(y) ∧ (x < y)]
(f) ∀x∃y[Prime(x) ∧ (x < y)]

$\forall x \exists y[Prime(y) \land Prime(x) \land x \lt y]$



4. The symbol ∃!x means “There exists a unique x such that . . . ” Which of the following accurately
defines the expression ∃!xφ(x)?
(a) ∃x∀y[φ(x) ∧ [φ(y) ⇒ (x 6= y)]]
(b) ∃x[φ(x) ∧ (∃y)[φ(y) ⇒ (x 6= y)]]
(c) ∃x∃y[(φ(x) ∧ φ(y)) ⇒ (x = y)]
(d) [∃xφ(x)] ∧ (∀y)[φ(y) ⇒ (x = y)]
1
(e) ∃x[φ(x) ∧ (∀y)[φ(y) ⇒ (x = y)]]

a

5. Which of the following means “The arithmetic operation x↑y is not commutative.” (↑ is just some
arbitrary binary operation.)
(a) ∀x∀y[x↑y 6= y ↑x]
(b) ∀x∃y[x↑y 6= y ↑x]
(c) ∃x∃y[x↑y 6= y ↑x]
(d) ∃x∀y[x↑y 6= y ↑x]

c

6. Evaluate this purported proof, and grade it according to the course rubric.
Claim: There does not exist a positive integer N such that N2 + 4N + 3 is prime.
Proof: N2 + 4N + 3 = (N + 1)(N + 3). This is not prime.
