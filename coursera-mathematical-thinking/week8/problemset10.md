1. Say which of the following are true. (Leave the box empty to indicate that itâ€™s false.)

â€¢ A set A of reals can have at most one least upper bound.

True

â€¢ If a set A of reals has a lower bound, it has infinitely many lower bounds.

True

â€¢ If a set A of reals has both a lower bound and an upper bound, then it is finite.

False

â€¢ 0 is the least upper bound of the set of negative integers, considered as a subset of the reals.

True. Negative integers are $(-\infty, 0)$

TODO: this is false

2. Which of the following say that b is the greatest lower bound of a set A of reals? (Leave the box
empty to indicate that it does not say that.)

â€¢ b â‰¤ a for all a âˆˆ A and if c â‰¤ a for all a âˆˆ A, then b â‰¥ c.

True. If it's for all

â€¢ b â‰¤ a for all a âˆˆ A and if c â‰¤ a for all a âˆˆ A, then b > c.

TODO: This is false

True. If it's for all. Closed or open set shouldn't matter

â€¢ b < a for all a âˆˆ A and if c < a for all a âˆˆ A, then b â‰¥ c.

False. b must be in A.

â€¢ b < a for all a âˆˆ A and if c â‰¤ a for all a âˆˆ A, then b â‰¥ c.

False. b must be in A.

â€¢ b â‰¤ a for all a âˆˆ A and if $\epsilon$ > 0 there is an a âˆˆ A such that a < b + $\epsilon$.

True.

3. The Sandwich Theorem (also sometimes called the Squeeze Theorem) says that if {an}âˆž
n=1, {bn}âˆž
n=1,
{cn}âˆž
n=1 are sequences such that, from some point n0 onwards,
an â‰¤ bn â‰¤ cn,
and if
limnâ†’âˆž
an = L , limnâ†’âˆž
cn = L,
then {bn}âˆž
n=1 is convergent and
limnâ†’âˆž
bn = L.
Taking the Sandwich Theorem to be correct (which it is), grade the following proof using the course
rubric.

limnâ†’âˆž
sin2 n

= 0
as required.

This theorem doesn't prove anything. It just uses the squeeze theorem and applies it.

4. Is the following proof of the Sandwich Theorem correct? Grade it according to the course rubric.
Theorem (Sandwich Theorem) Suppose {an}âˆž
n=1, {bn}âˆž
n=1, {cn}âˆž
n=1 are sequences such that, from
some point n0 onwards,
an â‰¤ bn â‰¤ cn.
Suppose further that
limnâ†’âˆž
an = L , limnâ†’âˆž
cn = L.
Then {bn}âˆž
n=1 is convergent and
limnâ†’âˆž
bn = L.
Proof: Since limnâ†’âˆž
an = L, we can find an integer n1 such that
n â‰¥ n1 â‡’ |an âˆ’ L| < 
Since limnâ†’âˆž
cn = L, we can find an integer n2 such that
n â‰¥ n2 â‡’ |cn âˆ’ L| < 
Let M = max{n0, n1, n2}. Then
n â‰¥ M â‡’ (âˆ’ < anâˆ’L < ) âˆ§ (âˆ’ < cnâˆ’L < )
â‡’ âˆ’ < anâˆ’L â‰¤ bnâˆ’L â‰¤ cnâˆ’L <  (using an â‰¤ bn â‰¤ cn)
â‡’ âˆ’ < bnâˆ’L < 
â‡’ |bn âˆ’ L| < 
By the definition of a limit, this proves that {bn}âˆž
n=1 is convergent and limnâ†’âˆž
bn = L, as required.

20 points. This has very sound logic. I'm just a little confused how the proof got to introducing one step

TODO: This grade is good. The student is just missing the initial assumption.
