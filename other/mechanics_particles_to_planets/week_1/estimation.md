## Dentists in Sydney

How many dentists are there in Sydney? Here are some relevant data. Sydney's population is about 5 million people. Suppose that, on average, each person spends 2 hours at the dentist every year. 

We can also safetly assume that each dentist work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and 52 weeks a year for a total of <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=5*8*52=2080\text{&space;hours&space;per&space;year}&space;\therefore&space;\frac{2080}{2}&space;=&space;1000\text{&space;patients&space;per&space;dentist&space;per&space;year}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?5*8*52=2080\text{&space;hours&space;per&space;year}&space;\therefore&space;\frac{2080}{2}&space;=&space;1000\text{&space;patients&space;per&space;dentist&space;per&space;year}" title="5*8*52=2080\text{ hours per year} \therefore \frac{2080}{2} = 1000\text{ patients per dentist per year}" /></a>

Therefore, if the are 5000000 people in Sydney and we want to figure how many dentists this requires:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\frac{5000000}{1040}&space;\approx&space;4807\text{&space;dentists}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{5000000}{1040}&space;\approx&space;4807\text{&space;dentists}" title="\frac{5000000}{1040} \approx 4807\text{ dentists}" /></a>

## Cells in body

How many cells in a human? Assume that cells have a typical size of about 10 µm (<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=1&space;\mu\text{m}&space;=&space;10^{-6}\text{&space;m}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1&space;\mu\text{m}&space;=&space;10^{-6}\text{&space;m}" title="1 \mu\text{m} = 10^{-6}\text{ m}" /></a>) in all directions. And that we are the same density as water, and are made completely of cells.

* Assume density of human = density of water = .98 g/m^3
* Average mass of a human = 70000 grams

We use the following equation to get the number of cells, just as we did to get the number of dentists:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\text{Number&space;of&space;cells&space;in&space;human}&space;=&space;\frac{\text{volume&space;of&space;human}}{\text{volume&space;of&space;cell}}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\text{Number&space;of&space;cells&space;in&space;human}&space;=&space;\frac{\text{volume&space;of&space;human}}{\text{volume&space;of&space;cell}}" title="\text{Number of cells in human} = \frac{\text{volume of human}}{\text{volume of cell}}" /></a>

Since we don't know the volum of a human but do know the density and mass, we can use the density equation to derive the volume 

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\text{density}&space;=&space;\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}&space;\therefore&space;\text{volume&space;of&space;human}&space;=&space;\frac{\text{Mass&space;of&space;human}}{\text{Density&space;of&space;human}}&space;\therefore&space;\text{Number&space;of&space;cells}&space;=&space;\frac{\text{Mass&space;of&space;human}}{\text{Density&space;of&space;human}*\text{Volume&space;of&space;cell}}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\text{density}&space;=&space;\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}&space;\therefore&space;\text{volume&space;of&space;human}&space;=&space;\frac{\text{Mass&space;of&space;human}}{\text{Density&space;of&space;human}}&space;\therefore&space;\text{Number&space;of&space;cells}&space;=&space;\frac{\text{Mass&space;of&space;human}}{\text{Density&space;of&space;human}*\text{Volume&space;of&space;cell}}" title="\text{density} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} \therefore \text{volume of human} = \frac{\text{Mass of human}}{\text{Density of human}} \therefore \text{Number of cells} = \frac{\text{Mass of human}}{\text{Density of human}*\text{Volume of cell}}" /></a>

## How many atoms in a grain of sand?

This one requires more steps, but let's find an answer. This question is an order-of-magnitude estimate. Approximate as a power of ten.

When you enter your answer, give only the exponent. For example, if you think there are 10^{32}10
32
  atoms in a grain of sand, write 3232.

Before you begin, here's a datum to start you off: 20 grams of sand contains 6 \times 10^{23}6×10
23
 atoms*. (For people used to imperial units, a gram is 0.035 ounces and a kilogram is 2.2 pounds mass. But, because this is a science course, you'll need to get used to kilograms and the rest of the metric units.)

What about the density of sand? Is it higher or lower than that of water (1000 \text{ kg/m}^31000 kg/m
3
 )? How do you know? Is it higher or lower than that of iron (7860 \text { kg/m}^37860 kg/m 
3
 )? This is an order-of-magnitude problem, so that's close enough! You'll also need to know the size of a grain of sand: now where could you possibly find that out?

 * volume of a grain of sand is approximately .3mm^3 (from the video)

How many cells in a human?

And that we are the same density as water, and are made completely of cells (both exaggerations, of course, but fine for an order of magnitude estimate).
