**Objectivism** - Morality is true/false
**Moral Relativism** - Morality is relative to the culture that you belong to
**Subjectivism** - This is an extreme form of moral relativism where morality is relative to the person who created the idea.
**Emotivism** - Moral Judgements are neither objectively true/false nor relatively true/false. They're direct expressions of our emotive reactions

Since emotivism takes our moral judments to be be mere expressions of our emotional reactivions, it faces the challenge of explaing how people appear to reason their way to moral judments

a challenge to objectivism is that we do not seem to have an objective method for resolving moral disputes.
