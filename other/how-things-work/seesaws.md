Seesaws are all about rotational motion.

Suppose you and a child half your height lean out over the edge of a swimming pool at the same angle. If you both let go at the same time, who will
 hit the water first?
 
 # How does a balanced seesaw move?
 
 A balanced seesaw rotates steadily about a fixed axis. a balanced seesaw exhibits **rotational inertia**, if a rotating object is kept rotating, it will 
 continue to rotate at that constant rate. This leads us to our first draft for **Newton's First Law of Rotational Motion** - A rigid object that is not 
 wobbling and that is free of external torques rotates at constant angular velocity.
 
 **Angular Position**- An object's orientation
 
 Physicists and Mathematicians use the **right hand rule** to decide which direction is up and down when rotating. You rotate with your hand 
 and whatever direction the thumb of your right hand is pointing when you finish the rotation is the direction of your rotation.
 
 **Angular Velocity**- The rate at which an object's angular position is changing with time.
 
 A **torque** is an upset to an object's rotational inertia. A twist is a torque
 
 The Earth is an example of an object that follows Newton's first law of rotational motion because it experiences practically no external torque.
 
 A balanced seesaw is not necessarily motionless as it experiences rotational inertia. 
 
 When a seesaw on a playground hits the ground, the ground acts as a torque and upsets the rotational inertia of the seesaw.
 
 # Why does a seesaw need a pivot?
 
 # Why does a lone seesaw rider plummet to the ground?
 
 # Why do the riders' weights and positions affect the seesaw's motion?
 
 # Why do the riders' distances from the pivot affect the seesaw's responsiveness?
 
 # How do the seesaw's riders affect one another?
