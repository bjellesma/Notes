Seesaws are all about rotational motion.

Suppose you and a child half your height lean out over the edge of a swimming pool at the same angle. If you both let go at the same time, who will
 hit the water first?
 
 # How does a balanced seesaw move?
 
 A balanced seesaw rotates steadily about a fixed axis. a balanced seesaw exhibits **rotational inertia**, if a rotating object is kept rotating, it will 
 continue to rotate at that constant rate. This leads us to our first draft for **Newton's First Law of Rotational Motion** - A rigid object that is not 
 wobbling and that is free of external torques rotates at constant angular velocity.
 
 **Angular Position**- An object's orientation
 
 Physicists and Mathematicians use the **right hand rule** to decide which direction is up and down when rotating. You rotate with your hand 
 and whatever direction the thumb of your right hand is pointing when you finish the rotation is the direction of your rotation.
 
 **Angular Velocity**- The rate at which an object's angular position is changing with time.
 
 A **torque** is an upset to an object's rotational inertia. A twist is a torque
 
 The Earth is an example of an object that follows Newton's first law of rotational motion because it experiences practically no external torque.
 
 A balanced seesaw is not necessarily motionless as it experiences rotational inertia. 
 
 When a seesaw on a playground hits the ground, the ground acts as a torque and upsets the rotational inertia of the seesaw.
 
 # Why does a seesaw need a pivot?
 
 A pivot prevents the seesaw from undergoing translational motion while leaving it free to undergo rotational motion. An object with rotational motion will rotate about its **center of mass**, the object's natural pivot. For example, in the following image, the hammer rotates around the mallet while it is in free fall because the mallet is its center of mass.

 In the case of a falling ball, its center of mass is its geometric center so it appears to not rotate as it's falling. 
 
 **Center of Rotation** - the point about which all physical quantities of rotational motion are defined. The center of rotation and center of mass for a seesaw are its pivot.
 
 # Why does a lone seesaw rider plummet to the ground?
 
 The lone rider produces a torque on the seesaw that causes it to overcome rotational inertia and undergo rapid angular acceleration. The weight of the rider is a force that, acting in conjunction with the lever arm of the seesaw, produces a torque on the seesaw.
 
 What's interesting is you can increase the rotational inertia of an object by adding objects of the same size and thus a torque of the same mass wouldn't be able to overcome rotational inertia as quickly.
 
 ![Rotational Acceleration](images/rotational_acceleration.gif)
 
 **Moment of Inertia** - The measure of an object's rotational inertia - its resistence to undergoing angular acceleration.
 
 This definition allows us to define **Newton's Second Law of Rotational Motion** - angular acceleration is equal to the net torque acting on the object divided by the moment of inertia, <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\alpha&space;=&space;\frac{\sum&space;\tau}{\text{I}}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha&space;=&space;\frac{\sum&space;\tau}{\text{I}}" title="\alpha = \frac{\sum \tau}{\text{I}}" /></a>
 
 An object's rotational acceleration is proportal to the net torque acting on the object.
 
 In order to produce a torque on an object, you need to exert a force at a right angle to the lever arm of an object. The **Lever arm** is a vector that extends outward from a **center of rotation**, the point around which an object will rotate, towards the causation of the torque. Notice how the resulting torque is always upwardly perpendicular to the lever arm. The resulting torque is also governed by the right hand rule.
 
 ![Producing Torque](images/producing-torque.PNG)
 
 The amount of force that we need to produce the torque is larger the shorter the lever arm. Therefore, if we're pushing or pulling on the door closer to the center of rotation, it will require more force. Therefore, the torque is equal to the lever arm multiplied by the force, <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\tau&space;=&space;rF" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\tau&space;=&space;rF" title="\tau = rF" /></a>
 
 ![Small lever arm](images/small_lever_arm.gif)
 
 A common household example of this is using a wrench on a stuck bolt. The wrench increases the lever arm vector and therefore, your force can produce a larger torque.
 
 # Why do the riders' weights and positions affect the seesaw's motion?
 
 They affect the net torque on the seesaw and cause angular acceleration to occur. When the riders sit on opposite sides of the seesaw, they produce opposite torques that produce zero or near zero net torque and therefore zero or near zero angular acceleration. If one rider does produce a bigger torque than the other (they have more weight), they'll just move closer to the pivot.
 
 ![Net Torque Cancellation](images/net-torque-cancellation.png)
 
 When zero net torque is produced on an object, we say that the object in **balanced**
 
 An object's **center of gravity** is the effective location of the object's weight. Near the Earth's surface, often an object's centers of gravity is the same location as the object's center of mass. Because center of gravity has to do with an object's weight, a force, and center of mass has to do with an object's mass, a constant quantity, these concepts are fundamentally different. In space, center of gravity has near no effect because there is near no gravity. The center of gravity on a balanced seesaw is located straight above the object's center of rotation so that it produces zero net torque and leaves the object rotationally inertial.
 
What makes a seesaw fun is that the riders can adjust the torque on the seesaw by pushing against the ground with their feet. They can also lean forwards or backwards to adjust the length of the lever arm and therefore the angular acceleration.
 
 # Why do the riders' distances from the pivot affect the seesaw's responsiveness?

 # How do the seesaw's riders affect one another?
