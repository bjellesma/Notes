Two puppies are fighting over a toy. Each puppy grips one end of that toy in its mouth and pulls. Suddenly, the puppy on the right pulls especially hard on the toy and moves its end of the toy to the right. The other puppy manages to keep its end of the toy from moving. Alas, the toy breaks and the game ends. Breaking the toy required energy and that energy was provided


only by the puppy on the right.

Correct 

by both puppies, but most was provided by the puppy on the right.


only by the puppy on the left.


in equal amounts by the two puppies.

In the game of shuffleboard, you push plastic disks forward and then release them so that they slide across a level playing surface. Once you release a disk, you are no longer pushing and it gradually skids to a stop. Its final position determines your score. As each disk skids to a stop, what becomes of the kinetic energy it had when you released it? That energy is


now elastic potential energy in the disk.

You take off your shoes to sneak quietly into your home late at night. Unfortunately, it's too dark to see the concrete block your friend left on the floor and your big toe collides with it. The block doesn't move and your foot comes to a complete stop due to the impact. Luckily, you are wearing soft woolen socks because when your foot stops during the impact, your toe transfers


less momentum to the block than it would have if you had not been wearing socks.


less velocity to the block than it would have if you had not been wearing socks.
