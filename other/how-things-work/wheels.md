# Why does a wagon need wheels?

A wheelless wajon would struggle against friction whenever it moved. Unlike support forces which act perpendicular to the object. **Fricitional Forces** act parallel to the object. Frictional Forces are Forces acting to oppose relative motion between two surfaces in contact and exerted parallel to those surfaces.

If you slide a book across a table, the wagon will exert frictional forces on the table and the table will in response, exert friction forces on the book causing the book to stop suddenly. You don't see the frictional forces caused on the table because the table is sturdy and attached to the earth. If you were to place a tablecloth between the table and book, you would see the friction that the wagon causes as the tablecloth would ride up.

If you were to hold a can between two fingers, you are supporting the can's weight with the help of upward frictional forces. As your fingers exert inward support forces on the can, perpendicular to the can's surfaces, you make it possible for your fingers to exert vertical frictional forces on the can, parallel to the can's surface. Your fingers exert upward frictional forces on the can, cancelling the can's downward weight so that it doesn't fall.


# Why is sliding a box across the floor usually hardest at the start?

The surfaces of the box and floor settle into one another while at rest so they're particularly resistant to the start of sliding

The support forces are greatest when an object at rest is being supported so, to overcome those great support forces, the frictional force will need to be great.

If you were to hold down this box, the support forces would be even greater, therefore even larger frictional forces are needed to overcome this.

Generally speaking, the higher the **coefficient of friction**, the better an object is at gripping another object. For example, objects with a coefficient of Friction of 1 mean that every 1 newton of support force generates 1 newton of frictional force.

The front wheels of a car can obtain larger frictional forces because the engine is located above the front wheels and exert larger support forces.
This is the reason why most cars nowadays are front wheel drive; because the front wheels have a higher coefficient of friction and, therefore, a better grip on the road and a better responsiveness to stopping/starting.

**Static Friction** is friction between two surfaces that are not in relative motion. **relative motion** means that these objects are not moving relative to each other.
Static friction can be thought of as what keeps your car motionless when you're parked on a hill.

**Sliding Friction** is the opposite of static friction as it is the fiction between two surfaces is relative motion.
If you attempt to slide a box with weights in it. The static friction will require a larger force exerted by you at first because of support forces. Once the static friction is overcome, the box moves with sliding friction.

## Will your car accelerate forward faster if you twist its wheels hard enough that they skid or if you twist them less hard so that the barely avoid skidding?

If you twist them less hard and barely avoid skidding, the street will exert a static friction force on the wheels and you'll accelerate faster.

# How is energy wasted as a box skids to a stop?

Sliding friction transforms the box's kinetic energy to thermal energy.

When you slide a box on the floor, the floor does negative work on the box because the box is coming to a stop but the box does no work on the floor as the floor doesn't move. Instead, energy is "wasted" as thermal energy as it slides.
In contrast, static friction wastes no energy.

Because wheels have a high coefficient of friction and can absorb static friction much better, they are mush more efficient than just sliding an object along a surface.

# How do wheels help a box coast?

Wheels eliminate sliding friction between the wagon and the ground.

A ball bearing is used to reduce sliding friction of the wheels.

The inner ring can turn independently of the outer ring because the balls are used to eliminate the sliding friction.

# How do powered wheels propel a car forward?

The ground exerts a forward static frictional force on each powered wheel and thereby pushes the car forward.

As a runner in a sprint, you typically have spikes on your feet to give you better traction and therefore higher static friction.

**Power** is the rate at which energy is transferred from one object to another. Remember that energy is defined as the capacity to do work. Therefore, power can be thought of as the rate at which work is done. A joule is the unit of measurement for work so joules/seconds is the unit of measurement for power. Joules/second is comonly called the **watt**.

1 horsepower is approximately 750 watts. 

If an appliance was labeled as 1000 watts, it would consume 60,000 joules in one minute. Since a watt is just a joule consumed in one second, we can multiply 1000 watts by 60 seconds to arrive at 60,000 joules. We say joules instead of watts because watts applies only to the rate at which power is transferred. In one hour, you will have consumed 3,600,600 joules.

3,600,000 joules consumed in one hour is exactly 1 **kilowatt-hour** because it works down to 1000 watts or 1000 joules/second.

# How is energy present in a wheel?

The wheel has kinetic energy in its translation and rotational motions. 

For a translating object, <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=Kinetic&space;Energy&space;=&space;\frac{1}{2}Mass&space;*&space;Speed^{2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Kinetic&space;Energy&space;=&space;\frac{1}{2}Mass&space;*&space;Speed^{2}" title="Kinetic Energy = \frac{1}{2}Mass * Speed^{2}" /></a>. Keep in mind that this squared factor means that an object traveling twice as fast as an equally massed object with have 4 times as much kinetic energy. For exampld, if car A is traveling at 2 mph and car B is traveling at 4 mph, since 2 squared is 4 and 4 squard is 16, Car B has 4 times as much kinetic energy.

Similarly, for a rotating object, <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=Kinetic&space;Energy&space;=&space;\frac{1}{2}\text{Rotational&space;Mass}&space;*&space;\text{Angular&space;Speed}^{2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Kinetic&space;Energy&space;=&space;\frac{1}{2}\text{Rotational&space;Mass}&space;*&space;\text{Angular&space;Speed}^{2}" title="Kinetic Energy = \frac{1}{2}\text{Rotational Mass} * \text{Angular Speed}^{2}" /></a>

Keeping in mind that using wheels will have both translational and rotational motion, wheels will carry a lot of kinetic energy as these quantities will add.

# Review

Using wheels will eliminate sliding friction which would waste energy by releasing it in the form of thermal energy. Wheels eliminate sliding frction, but static friction, the friction of touch and release, is still present in the wheels. Static friction will help the wheels undergo torques and cause angular acceleration.

Ice has a very low coefficient of friction making it trechorous to slide across.

# Quiz

1. Question 1
You are walking at constant velocity on a sidewalk that slopes gently uphill. What force(s) is the sidewalk exerting on you?


A frictional force directed uphill, parallel to the sidewalk's surface, and a support force directed perpendicular to the sidewalk's surface.


2. Question 2
For millennia, people have ground grain into flour by placing a thin layer of grain between two surfaces that slide across one another. Those two surfaces are usually stacked on top of one another and the surface above the grain is that of a very heavy object, such as a millstone. When motionless, the heavy millstone will exert large support forces on the grain and thereby crush that grain to some extent, but it won't make fine flour. Spinning the millstone while keeping the surface below the grain motionless, however, will grind the grain as fine as you like. What role does the millstone's weight play in this grinding process?

The grinding process uses both support forces to crush the grain and sliding frictional forces to wear the grain. Since frictional forces are approximately proportional to support forces, the millstone's weight enhances both the crushing and the wearing processes.

3. Question 3
Walking on ice can be treacherous, but some techniques are safer than others. In general, you are less likely to slip and fall if you lower your foot vertically into place on the ice as you take each step than you are if you slide your foot horizontally into place on the ice as you take each step. Why is the vertical landing method of walking on ice usually safer than the horizontal sliding method?

The static frictional forces you can obtain from the ice using the vertical landing method are larger, and more effective at preventing sideways slips, than the sliding friction forces you are likely to obtain from the ice using the horizontal sliding method.

4. Question 4
Most automobiles have mechanical brakes on all four of their wheels. Each of these brakes consists of two surfaces—one surface that rotates with the wheel and one surface that doesn't rotate. When you put your foot on the brake pedal in such an automobile, those two surfaces begin to slide across one another. The harder you press on the brake pedal, the more tightly those surfaces are pressed against one another. Why do the brakes permit the two surfaces to slide across one another, rather than locking those two surfaces together so that they don't slide across one another?


The purpose of the brakes is to waste the moving automobile's kinetic energy, using sliding friction, and thereby slowing the automobile safely. Locking the brakes would result in static friction in the brakes and prevent the brakes themselves from wasting more than a tiny fraction of the automobile's kinetic energy.


5. Question 5
The harder you press on an automobile's brake pedal, the greater the support forces that the two surfaces in each brake exert on one another. Why does this increase in support forces in the brakes result in more rapid deceleration (acceleration opposite its velocity) of the automobile?


The sliding frictional forces the two brake surfaces exert on one another are approximately proportional to their support forces on one another. As the support forces increase, the sliding frictional forces also increase; they waste the automobile's kinetic energy faster, so that it slows more rapidly.


6. Question 6
The front wheel of your bicycle spins freely on its axle and rotates at almost constant angular velocity if nothing outside the bicycle exerts a torque on it. Suppose the front wheel is motionless as you stand next to your bicycle. You get on the bicycle and pedal forward. As the bicycle begins to move forward, why does its front wheel begin to rotate?


The ground exerts a backward static frictional force on the bottom of the front wheel to prevent that wheel from sliding across the ground. That frictional force, exerted at a lever arm from the wheel's center of rotation, produces the torque that causes the wheel to begin rotating.

7. Question 7
When you drive a car on a level (horizontal) road that is slippery with ice, you usually have no problems except when you try to speed up, slow down, or turn. Why does the icy road make those three actions hazardous? [neglect any effects due to air]


Each action involves a horizontal acceleration and requires a horizontal force. The only forces that level pavement can exert on the car are frictional forces and the slippery ice reduces those frictional forces.

8. Question 8
Pedaling your bicycle provides power to its rear wheel and propels your bicycle forward. What force(s) is principally responsible for the bicycle's forward acceleration as you pedal your bicycle forward from rest on a level (horizontal) road?



The pavement exerts a forward frictional force on the bottom of the rear wheel.

9. Question 9
If you throw a ball directly upward at 10 meters-per-second (22 mph), it will rise upward about 5 meters before coming momentarily to a stop. If you throw that ball directly upward at 20 meters-per-second (44 mph), how far will it rise upward before coming momentarily to a stop?


About 20 meters.

10. Question 10
Earth's oceans exhibit tides, so that the average water level near most shores rises and falls at roughly six-hour intervals. A somewhat simplistic explanation for the tides is that the moon's and sun's gravity slightly distort Earth's oceans, creating high and low regions, and the Earth's rotation causes those high and low regions to shift on the Earth's surface. There are a few tidal generating plants on Earth that use energy in the tides to generate electricity. Where does nearly all of the energy in the tides originally come from?


The kinetic energy in the Earth rotational motion.
