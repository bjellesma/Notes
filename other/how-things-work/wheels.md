# Why does a wagon need wheels?

A wheelless wajon would struggle against friction whenever it moved. Unlike support forces which act perpendicular to the object. **Fricitional Forces** act parallel to the object. Frictional Forces are Forces acting to oppose relative motion between two surfaces in contact and exerted parallel to those surfaces.

If you slide a book across a table, the wagon will exert frictional forces on the table and the table will in response, exert friction forces on the book causing the book to stop suddenly. You don't see the frictional forces caused on the table because the table is sturdy and attached to the earth. If you were to place a tablecloth between the table and book, you would see the friction that the wagon causes as the tablecloth would ride up.

If you were to hold a can between two fingers, you are supporting the can's weight with the help of upward frictional forces. As your fingers exert inward support forces on the can, perpendicular to the can's surfaces, you make it possible for your fingers to exert vertical frictional forces on the can, parallel to the can's surface. Your fingers exert upward frictional forces on the can, cancelling the can's downward weight so that it doesn't fall.


# Why is sliding a box across the floor usually hardest at the start?

The surfaces of the box and floor settle into one another while at rest so they're particularly resistant to the start of sliding

The support forces are greatest when an object at rest is being supported so, to overcome those great support forces, the frictional force will need to be great.

If you were to hold down this box, the support forces would be even greater, therefore even larger frictional forces are needed to overcome this.

Generally speaking, the higher the **coefficient of friction**, the better an object is at gripping another object. For example, objects with a coefficient of Friction of 1 mean that every 1 newton of support force generates 1 newton of frictional force.

The front wheels of a car can obtain larger frictional forces because the engine is located above the front wheels and exert larger support forces.
This is the reason why most cars nowadays are front wheel drive; because the front wheels have a higher coefficient of friction and, therefore, a better grip on the road and a better responsiveness to stopping/starting.

**Static Friction** is friction between two surfaces that are not in relative motion. **relative motion** means that these objects are not moving relative to each other.
Static friction can be thought of as what keeps your car motionless when you're parked on a hill.

**Sliding Friction** is the opposite of static friction as it is the fiction between two surfaces is relative motion.
If you attempt to slide a box with weights in it. The static friction will require a larger force exerted by you at first because of support forces. Once the static friction is overcome, the box moves with sliding friction.

## Will your car accelerate forward faster if you twist its wheels hard enough that they skid or if you twist them less hard so that the barely avoid skidding?

If you twist them less hard and barely avoid skidding, the street will exert a static friction force on the wheels and you'll accelerate faster.

# How is energy wasted as a box skids to a stop?

Sliding friction transforms the box's kinetic energy to thermal energy.

When you slide a box on the floor, the floor does negative work on the box because the box is coming to a stop but the box does no work on the floor as the floor doesn't move. Instead, energy is "wasted" as thermal energy as it slides.
In contrast, static friction wastes no energy.

Because wheels have a high coefficient of friction and can absorb static friction much better, they are mush more efficient than just sliding an object along a surface.

# How do wheels help a box coast?

Wheels eliminate sliding friction between the wagon and the ground.

A ball bearing is used to reduce sliding friction of the wheels.

The inner ring can turn independently of the outer ring because the balls are used to eliminate the sliding friction.

# How do powered wheels propel a car forward?

The ground exerts a forward static frictional force on each powered wheel and thereby pushes the car forward.

As a runner in a sprint, you typically have spikes on your feet to give you better traction and therefore higher static friction.

**Power** is the rate at which energy is transferred from one object to another. Remember that energy is defined as the capacity to do work. Therefore, power can be thought of as the rate at which work is done. A joule is the unit of measurement for work so joules/seconds is the unit of measurement for power. Joules/second is comonly called the **watt**.

1 horsepower is approximately 750 watts. 

If an appliance was labeled as 1000 watts, it would consume 60,000 joules in one minute. Since a watt is just a joule consumed in one second, we can multiply 1000 watts by 60 seconds to arrive at 60,000 joules. We say joules instead of watts because watts applies only to the rate at which power is transferred. In one hour, you will have consumed 3,600,600 joules.

3,600,000 joules consumed in one hour is exactly 1 **kilowatt-hour** because it works down to 1000 watts or 1000 joules/second.
