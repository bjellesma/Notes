**Inertia** - An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion.

Until a force is exerted on an object's inertia, the object tends to stay the way it is.

In our example, the skater will continue to move in the same direction unless friction can slow them down. 
The skater can also remain stationary unless someone pushes them.

# Why does a stationary skater tend to remain stationary?

The short answer is that the skater has an inertia stating that an object at rest tends to stay at rest.

Another example of this is with the classic trick of pulling the table cloth from underneath dishes very quickly.
The idea behind this is that the objects are at rest and, if you pull the table cloth very quickly, minimal force will impact
the objects.

Yet another example is that an object being held in midair will remain in midair until gravity takes effect. In this case, gravity is only acting in the downward direction

*Notice how the force acting in the horizonal directions are so fast and minimal, the pencil falls straight into the empty bottle*

# Why does a moving skater tend to continue moving?

This answer is also inertia as an object in motion tends to stay in motion.

Skaters are mostly inertial, that is they moving in a straight line with zero force acting on them. They are said to be obeying **Newton's first law of motion**

# How can we describe the motion of a coasting skater?

A coasting skater moves at a constant **velocity** - a **vector** quantity consisting of a magnitude of speed and a direction. A **scalar** quantity is a quantity consisting of only a magnitude, like temperature. 

A **force** is a push or a pull and is another vector quantity. The SI unit for force is the newton (N). A more familiar unit for force in the US is the pound (lb).

We can now give a formal definition of **Newton's First Law of Motion** - An object that is free of external forces moves at a constant velocity. Returning to the example of the skater, a skater that is experience zero outside NET force moves at a constant velocity. This is never the case because of forces such as wind resistence and friction. We say net force because it is possible for forces in opposite directions to cancel one another. For example, if one person pushed a skater to the left and another person pushed that skater towards the right equally hard, the two forces would cancel, the skater would experience no net force. The skater would be inertial and move according to Newton's First Law of Motion.

# How does a skater start, stop, or turn?

A force acts on the akater and causes the skater to accelerate. **Acceleration** is the rate at which an object's velocity is changing with time. **Deceleration** is acceleration in the opposite direction and is what allows you to slow down and, eventually, stop. If you accelerate in another direction other than forward or opposite, you'll turn.

You only need 1 reference point to describe position, 2 reference points to describe velocity (position at time 0 and position at time 1), and 3 reference points to describe acceleration (position at time 0, position at time 1, and position at time 2). With three reference points for acceleration, you can see how the velocity vector changes between each reference point (velocity between 0 and 1 and velocity between 1 and 2).

When you push towards the left, you will accelerate towards the right

**Mass** is the measure of an object's inertia. This means that what you weigh is your inertia but also anything that you're carrying at the time is part of your inertia. Mass is actually inversely proportional to acceleration meaning if you push equally hard on several objects, its acceleration will be 1/Mass.

# Why does a skater need ice or wheels in order to skate?

Wheels or Ice do a very good job of overcoming friction. If you push a book across a table, the book looks as if it stops when you stop pushing on the book, but the book really decelerates to a stop very quickly because of friction. However, if you had that same book on wheels and gave the book a push, it would take a lot longer for the book to decelerate to a stop because wheels are so much better at overcoming friction.

# Quiz

1. While searching for your keys, you place your cup of coffee on the roof of your parked car. Unfortunately, you forget about the coffee and climb into the car without it. As you start driving the car forward, you hear the coffee hit the ground behind the car. Why didn't the coffee stay on the roof of the car?


The coffee's inertia kept it essentially motionless as the car accelerated forward and left the coffee behind.


2. An African swallow is flying east at 60 mph (about 100 km/h) and a European swallow is flying west at 60 mph (about 100 km/h). These two swallows have _______________.

the same speed, but different velocities.

3. You kick a soccer ball (a football) toward the goal. When the fast-moving ball is midway to the goal and nothing is touching it, why is the ball moving toward the goal? [Ignore any effects due to the air or gravity.

Inertia keeps the ball in motion.

4. Which of the following is experiencing zero net force?


A water-skier who is being pulled forward by a speedboat and is moving in a straight-line path at a steady speed.

5. You are riding your bicycle forward on a level road, traveling in a straight line at a steady pace. An animal suddenly runs in front of you, so you apply the brakes quickly and stop just in time to avoid hitting the animal. While the brakes are on and you are experiencing a large net force, what is the direction of velocity and acceleration, respectively?

Your velocity is forward, but your acceleration is backward.

6. You are coasting forward at constant velocity on your inline skates. Suddenly, another skater pushes you so that the net force you are experiencing points toward your left. While your net force points toward the left, your acceleration _______________.

points toward the left (in the direction of your net force).

7. Two skaters are coasting forward across the ice. The skater in red has a greater mass than the skater in blue. You begin pushing the two skaters forward with equal forces. How do they move while you are pushing them? [The correct answer must always be true, no matter how fast the skaters were moving before you began pushing them.]

The skater in red experiences less acceleration than the skater in blue.

8. In what circumstance can you be accelerating forward and still be moving at a constant velocity?

In no circumstance. If you are accelerating, you velocity is changing with time.

9. You are dragging a heavy chair across the floor and that chair is moving toward the east at constant velocity. The net force on the chair __________________.


is zero.

10. A set of dishes sits motionless on a slippery silk tablecloth. If you pull the tablecloth sideways quickly, it will slide out from under the dishes and leave the dishes almost unaffected. Why won't that same result occur if you pull the tablecloth sideways slowly?

The moving tablecloth exerts small forces on the dishes and, given enough time, those forces will overwhelm inertia and cause the dishes to move with the tablecloth.
