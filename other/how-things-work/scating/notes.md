**Inertia** - An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion.

Until a force is exerted on an object's inertia, the object tends to stay the way it is.

In our example, the skater will continue to move in the same direction unless friction can slow them down. 
The skater can also remain stationary unless someone pushes them.

# Why does a stationary skater tend to remain stationary?

The short answer is that the skater has an inertia stating that an object at rest tends to stay at rest.

Another example of this is with the classic trick of pulling the table cloth from underneath dishes very quickly.
The idea behind this is that the objects are at rest and, if you pull the table cloth very quickly, minimal force will impact
the objects.

Yet another example is that an object being held in midair will remain in midair until gravity takes effect. In this case, gravity is only acting in the downward direction

*Notice how the force acting in the horizonal directions are so fast and minimal, the pencil falls straight into the empty bottle*

# Why does a moving skater tend to continue moving?

This answer is also inertia as an object in motion tends to stay in motion.

Skaters are mostly inertial, that is they moving in a straight line with zero force acting on them. They are said to be obeying **Newton's first law of motion**

# How can we describe the motion of a coasting skater?

# How does a skater start, stop, or turn?

# Why does a skater need ice or wheels in order to skate?
