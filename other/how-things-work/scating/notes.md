**Inertia** - An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion.

Until a force is exerted on an object's inertia, the object tends to stay the way it is.

In our example, the skater will continue to move in the same direction unless friction can slow them down. 
The skater can also remain stationary unless someone pushes them.

# Why does a stationary skater tend to remain stationary?

The short answer is that the skater has an inertia stating that an object at rest tends to stay at rest.

Another example of this is with the classic trick of pulling the table cloth from underneath dishes very quickly.
The idea behind this is that the objects are at rest and, if you pull the table cloth very quickly, minimal force will impact
the objects.

# Why does a moving skater tend to continue moving?

# How can we describe the motion of a coasting skater?

# How does a skater start, stop, or turn?

# Why does a skater need ice or wheels in order to skate?
