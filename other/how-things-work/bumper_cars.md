# Does a moving bumper car carry a force?

No, the bumper car carries momentum but no force. **Momentum** is the conserved quantity of moving. It is conserved meaning it can't be created or destroyed but it can be transferred. Unlike energy, momentum cannot be stored so there's no such thing as potential momentum, for example. Momentum is only about motion so a stationary object has 0 momentum. Momentum is a vector quantity so it has a direction as well as a magnitude.

As you push on a wall, the wall will push on you and give you momentum in the direction that you want to move. When you bounce off of the opposite wall, you give your momentum to that wall.

Momentum depends on mass and velocity. Momentum is exactly proportional to mass in that the more massive the object, the more momentum that object will gain. An object with a velocity will decrease its velocity when it hits another object by a factor of the number of objects. For example, if one bumper car hits another motionless bumper car, the momentum is now decreased in the first bumper car by a factor of 2 as the second bumper car now gains the other half of the momentum. Because momentum is proportional to mass and velocity, we can use the following equation: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=Momentum&space;=&space;mass&space;*&space;velocity" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Momentum&space;=&space;mass&space;*&space;velocity" title="Momentum = mass * velocity" /></a>

If you drop a big melon off of a tall building, the melon has enormous downward momentum and transfers all of that momentum to the ground when it hits.

Suppose your spaceship is coasting forward through empty space at constant velocity. You decided to get rid of some trash by throwing it backward out behind the ship. In other words, you give the trash backward momentum. What effect, if any, does this action have on your ship's velocity?


Your ship's forward velocity increases.
Momentum is conserved, so whatever momentum you give to the trash is no longer present in the ship. By giving the trash backward momentum, you and the ship give up some backward momentum. Giving up backward momentum is the same as obtaining forward momentum. You and the ship thus have more forward momentum than before you threw out the trash. Since the mass of you and the ship has decreased slightly and you have more forward momentum, your forward velocity has increased.

This is the idea of how rockets work. By throwing gases out of the back of the rocket, the rocket obtains forward momentum. Combine this with the fact that the rocket now has less mass and the rocket travels at a much greater velocity.

# How is momentum transferred from one bumper car to another?

The first bumper car does an impulse on the second bumper car. An **impulse** is the mechanical means of tranferring momentum. An impulse is a force exerted for a time and can be calculated by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=Impulse&space;=&space;Force&space;*&space;Time" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Impulse&space;=&space;Force&space;*&space;Time" title="Impulse = Force * Time" /></a> For example, if you push a cart to set it in motion, you are doing an impulse on the cart. But at the same time, the cart will perform an impulse on you.

The padding between the impact and the impacter will help to absorb some on the impulse by increasing the time that it takes for the momentum to transfer. For example, if you put some rubber tape on the end of a hammer as you try toawa

When you catch a ball, you need to make your arms move with the ball so that the ball can transfer both energy and momentum to you. If you hold your hands rigidly in place, the ball will transfer momentum to you, but no energy.

# Does a spinning bumper car carry a torque?

No, a spinning bumper car carries a angular momentum. **Angular Momentum** is the conserved quantity of turning. Summing up, a bumper car carry three conserved quantities: translation momentum, angular momentum, and energy. <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\text{Angular&space;Momentum}&space;=&space;\text{Moment&space;of&space;Inertia}&space;*&space;\text{Angular&space;Velocity}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\text{Angular&space;Momentum}&space;=&space;\text{Moment&space;of&space;Inertia}&space;*&space;\text{Angular&space;Velocity}" title="\text{Angular Momentum} = \text{Moment of Inertia} * \text{Angular Velocity}" /></a> 
. As an example of this equation, if an ice skater starts spinning with their arms outward (a large moment of inertia) and then bring their arms inward during the spin, they will start to spin faster because of angular velocity; their moment of inertia has decreased so their angular velocity will increase to compensate.

## If you pull yourself to the center of a spinning merry-go-round, what will happen to its rotation?

The merry-go-round will start spinning faster because your mass contributes significantly to the moment of inertia of the object. Therefore, when you pull you pull yourself to the center of the merry go round, you are decreasing the object's moment of inertia and its angular velocity will need to increase to compensate. Going off of this subject, heavy riders in a car will contribute significantly to the car's moment of inertia and will spin slower given angular momentum.

# How is angular momentum transferred from one bumper car to another?

The first car will perform an angular impulse on the second bumper car to get it spinning. Similar to how we defined an impulse, **<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\text{Angular&space;Impulse}&space;=&space;\text{Torque}&space;*&space;\text{Time}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\text{Angular&space;Impulse}&space;=&space;\text{Torque}&space;*&space;\text{Time}" title="\text{Angular Impulse} = \text{Torque} * \text{Time}" /></a>**

# How does a bumper car move on an uneven floor?

The bumper car accelerates in the direction that reduces its total potential energy as quickly as possible.

If you swing a pendulum, it will accelerate to the other side and when it comes back towards you, it can't go any farther than its initial starting position because that would require making energy out of nothing.

A **gradient** is a gradual variation in a physical quantity near a particular position. When a dog catches a scent of food, it's following a scent gradient, find the direction in which that smell increases most.

# Quiz

A meteor is streaking toward city hall and will hit the building in a few second. As it moves through the sky, what physical quantities is the meteor carrying with it? [Ignore any effects due to air or Earth's gravity]

Correct 
Answer: Energy, momentum directed toward city hall, but no force.

Explanation: The meteor carries several conserved quantities with it, including energy and momentum, but it cannot carry a force with it. Forces are not conserved quantities and are exerted between objects rather than carried by them. The fact that the meteor is carrying an enormous amount of momentum directed toward city hall means that when it actually hits city hall, the meteor will exert a large impact force on city hall as it transfers some of its momentum to city hall by way of an impulse.

2. Question 2
You have a midnight craving for ice cream and are walking quickly through your pitch-black apartment when you collide with the wall. You come to a complete stop. Fortunately, your interior decorator mounted a thick woolen tapestry (wall-hanging) on the concrete wall and that soft tapestry saves you from injury. Compare the momentum you transferred while coming to a stop on the tapestry-covered wall to the momentum you would have transferred if you had come to a stop on the bare concrete wall.

Correct 
Answer: You would have transferred the same momentum in either case, but in stopping on the tapestry-covered wall you transferred that momentum with a smaller force over a longer period of time.

Explanation: Since momentum is conserved, the momentum you transfer to the tapestry or wall must be equal to your change in momentum. Since your change in momentum is the same in either case (you come to a complete stop), the momentum you transfer to the tapestry is the same as the momentum you would have transferred to the bare concrete wall. You thus do the same impulse on either the tapestry or the concrete wall. While stopping on the soft tapestry, you did the impulse by exerting a relatively small force on the tapestry for a long time. Had you stopped on the hard concrete wall, however, you would have done the impulse by exerting a relatively large force on the wall for a short time. The concrete wall would have exerted an equal but oppositely directed force on you during that impact and it would have hurt. Colliding with the soft tapestry prolonged the momentum transfer and resulted in more gentle, less painful forces.

3. Question 3
A car traveling at 60 mph (100 km/h) veers off the road and hits a tree. The car immediately comes to a complete stop. Fortunately, the airbag inflates and the driver comes to a stop in the airbag instead of coming to a stop on the steering wheel. Hitting the airbag rather than the steering wheel saves the driver's life because the driver


Answer: transfers all of her momentum to whatever stops her, but that transfer is slower and involves a smaller force when she hits the airbag.

Explanation: While the car and driver are moving forward, the driver carries several conserved quantities with her. One of those conserved quantities is momentum and the driver's momentum is directed forward. Force is not a conserved quantity and is exerted between objects rather than carried by individual objects, so the driver cannot carry a force with her. When the car collides with the tree, the car stops abruptly and the driver is suddenly surrounded by nearly motionless objects. Fortunately, she collides with the airbag. She transfers all of her forward momentum to that airbag, just as she would have transferred all of her forward momentum to the steering wheel. But while the momentum-transferring impulse she did to the airbag was the same as the impulse she would have done to the steering wheel, the airbag impulse took more time and therefore involved a smaller, safer impact force. Incidentally, the car crumpled strategically during its collision with the tree to further prolong the driver's impulse with the airbag. Moreover, the crumpling car and airbag also let the driver to work on them and rid herself of excess kinetic energy. Together, the car and airbag did everything they could to extract the driver's energy and momentum slowly, gently, and safely, so that she walked away uninjured.

4. Question 4
A diver stands upright at the edge of the 10 meter platform at the Olympics. The diver jumps off the platform, folds into a ball shape, completes 3.5 somersaults, unfold out of the ball shape, and plunges head-first into the water. Compare the diver's angular momentum about the diver's center of mass at three different moments while that diver is not touching anything: (a) before folding into a ball shape, (b) while ball-shaped, and (c) after unfolding out of the ball shape [Note that the diver's weight, which acts at the diver's center of gravity, produces zero torque on the diver about the diver's center of mass. Ignore any effects due to the air.]


Correct 
Answer: The diver's angular momentum is the same at all three moments.

Explanation: While the diver is not touching anything, the diver is experiencing zero torque about the diver's center of mass and cannot be exchanging angular momentum with anything else. The diver's angular momentum is therefore constant throughout the dive. That constancy of angular momentum accounts for some of the challenge of doing complicated dives. The diver must leave the platform with enough angular momentum to complete all the desired somersaults and/or twists, but the diver must somehow look as if the diver is not rotating when entering the water. It's not easy.

The chef at a pizza restaurant tosses a spinning disk of pizza dough into the air. As the disk stretches outward in midair and its diameter increases, what happens to the disk's angular momentum and angular velocity about the disk's center of mass? [Note that the disk's weight, which acts at the disk's center of gravity, produces zero torque on the disk about the disk's center of mass. Ignore any effects due to the air.]


Correct 
Answer: The disk's angular momentum is constant, but the disk's angular velocity decreases.

Explanation: The disk is isolated from external torques, so its angular momentum is constant. As the disk's diameter increases, its mass shifts farther from its center of mass (the center of rotation) so the disk's rotational mass increases. For the disk's angular momentum to remain constant as its rotational mass increases, the disk's angular velocity must decrease. Incidentally, because the disk is not rigid, Newton's first law of rotation does not apply to it.

6. Question 6
You are riding on a large carousel at an amusement park and you are enjoying the moving scenery as the carousel spins about its center of rotation. The ride comes to an end and the carousel gradually slows to a stop. Why does it take so long for the carousel to stop rotating?

Correct 
Answer: The spinning carousel carries a large amount of angular momentum and the angular impulse needed to remove that angular momentum with a reasonable torque requires a long time.

Explanation: The spinning carousel carries several conserved quantities, including angular momentum. When the ride ends, the carousel must transfer its large angular momentum to something else in order to slow to a stop. It must do an angular impulse on something else. That angular impulse is the product of the torque it exerts and the duration of that torque. To avoid having to exert an enormous, possible dangerous torque on whatever stops the carousel, the carousel stop slowly. It does its angular impulse using a smaller torque exerted for a longer time.

7. Question 7
A "lazy susan" is a disk-shaped rotating platform that a restaurant places at the center of a large dining table. Dishes of food are placed on the lazy susan and diners can rotate the lazy susan by hand to bring various dishes closer to them. A large torque exerted for a short time makes the motionless platform begin rotating rapidly, but that dangerous technique risks tipping over some of the food dishes. How can you make the same motionless platform and dishes begin rotating just as rapidly, but with a smaller, safer torque?

Correct 
Answer: Do the same angular impulse as the dangerous technique, but by exerting a smaller torque for a longer time.

Explanation: Since the lazy susan is the same as before and you want to make it spin just as rapidly as with the dangerous technique, you need to do the same angular impulse as the dangerous technique. That means that the product of your torque and the time (or duration) of that torque must be the same as for the dangerous technique. By using a smaller torque, exerted for a longer time, you can obtain that same angular impulse but without the abrupt and risky angular acceleration of the dangerous technique. The lazy susan will experience a slower angular acceleration and all the dishes will remain safely in place.

8. Question 8
To win a big prize at the fair or festival, all you have to do is toss a basketball into a bucket located about 10 feet (3 meters) in front of you and have the basketball remain in the bucket. The rigid bucket cannot move and it opens toward you. However, the bucket is tilted upward just enough that the basketball will remain in it if someone places the basketball in the bucket by hand. You try a dozen times to get the basketball to stay in the bucket, but it keeps bouncing back out of the bucket. Why is it so difficult for the basketball to come to rest in the bucket?

Answer: To stop moving, the basketball must transfer both energy and momentum to the bucket and, while it transfers momentum easily to the bucket, it transfers almost zero energy to the bucket.

Explanation: The fast-moving basketball carries energy and momentum as it approaches the bucket and it must get rid of both of those conserved quantities in order to stop moving. During its impact with the bucket, the basketball transfers momentum easily to the bucket by way of an impulse; it exerts a force on the bucket for time. Because the bucket is rigid and immovable, however, the basketball is unable to do any significant work on the bucket; it exerts a force on the bucket but the bucket barely moves any distance in the direction of that force. The basketball therefore cannot transfer any significant energy to the bucket. Instead of stopping in the bucket, the basketball bounces out of the bucket. It retains nearly all of its original energy, but it reverses its direction and therefore its momentum.

9. Question 9
You have just added a massive stone sculpture to your modern art collection. Unfortunately, the people who delivered the sculpture accidentally set it on its side. What barbarians! To tip the sculpture onto its proper base, you transfer as much momentum as you can to the highest point on the sculpture. You accomplish this transfer (successfully, I might add) by running full speed toward the sculpture and

Correct 
Answer: hitting the highest point on the sculpture with your feet as you jump against it so that you end up reversing your velocity.

Explanation: If you come to a stop due to your impact with the sculpture, you will have transferred all of your forward momentum to the sculpture. However, if you jump against the sculpture and reverse your velocity due to your impact, you will have given the sculpture more forward momentum than you had before impact. You will end up heading backward, opposite your original forward velocity, but you will have transferred an exceptionally large amount of forward momentum to the sculpture. By bouncing off the sculpture in this manner, you transfer more forward momentum to the sculpture than you could do by simple coming to rest against it.

10. Question 10
Your dynamic sculpture combines magnets, springs, and elastic bands with a variety of moving parts, including levers, pulleys, and pendulums. When someone jostles those parts, a complicated series of motions occurs and predicting how things will proceed seems nearly impossible. You point out, however, that there is a simple rule governing the motion of each part at any moment in time. That rule is that each part

Correct 
Answer: accelerates in the direction that reduces its total potential energy as quickly as possible.

Explanation: The parts may interact and therefore exchange energy, momentum, and angular momentum. They may also accelerate or coast, depending on the exact circumstances. What is always true, however, is that each part will accelerate in the direction that reduces its total potential energy as quickly as possible. In other words, it will accelerate in the direction opposite its total potential energy gradient.
