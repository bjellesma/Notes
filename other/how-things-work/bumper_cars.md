# Does a moving bumper car carry a force?

No, the bumper car carries momentum but no force. **Momentum** is the conserved quantity of moving. It is conserved meaning it can't be created or destroyed but it can be transferred. Unlike energy, momentum cannot be stored so there's no such thing as potential momentum, for example. Momentum is only about motion so a stationary object has 0 momentum. Momentum is a vector quantity so it has a direction as well as a magnitude.

As you push on a wall, the wall will push on you and give you momentum in the direction that you want to move. When you bounce off of the opposite wall, you give your momentum to that wall.

Momentum depends on mass and velocity. Momentum is exactly proportional to mass in that the more massive the object, the more momentum that object will gain. An object with a velocity will decrease its velocity when it hits another object by a factor of the number of objects. For example, if one bumper car hits another motionless bumper car, the momentum is now decreased in the first bumper car by a factor of 2 as the second bumper car now gains the other half of the momentum. Because momentum is proportional to mass and velocity, we can use the following equation: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=Momentum&space;=&space;mass&space;*&space;velocity" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Momentum&space;=&space;mass&space;*&space;velocity" title="Momentum = mass * velocity" /></a>

If you drop a big melon off of a tall building, the melon has enormous downward momentum and transfers all of that momentum to the ground when it hits.

Suppose your spaceship is coasting forward through empty space at constant velocity. You decided to get rid of some trash by throwing it backward out behind the ship. In other words, you give the trash backward momentum. What effect, if any, does this action have on your ship's velocity?


Your ship's forward velocity increases.
Momentum is conserved, so whatever momentum you give to the trash is no longer present in the ship. By giving the trash backward momentum, you and the ship give up some backward momentum. Giving up backward momentum is the same as obtaining forward momentum. You and the ship thus have more forward momentum than before you threw out the trash. Since the mass of you and the ship has decreased slightly and you have more forward momentum, your forward velocity has increased.

This is the idea of how rockets work. By throwing gases out of the back of the rocket, the rocket obtains forward momentum. Combine this with the fact that the rocket now has less mass and the rocket travels at a much greater velocity.

# How is momentum transferred from one bumper car to another?

The first bumper car does an impulse on the second bumper car. An **impulse** is the mechanical means of tranferring momentum. An impulse is a force exerted for a time and can be calculated by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=Impulse&space;=&space;Force&space;*&space;Time" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Impulse&space;=&space;Force&space;*&space;Time" title="Impulse = Force * Time" /></a> For example, if you push a cart to set it in motion, you are doing an impulse on the cart. But at the same time, the cart will perform an impulse on you.

The padding between the impact and the impacter will help to absorb some on the impulse by increasing the time that it takes for the momentum to transfer. For example, if you put some rubber tape on the end of a hammer as you try toawa

When you catch a ball, you need to make your arms move with the ball so that the ball can transfer both energy and momentum to you. If you hold your hands rigidly in place, the ball will transfer momentum to you, but no energy.
