**Weight** is the force exerted on an object by the gravity.

If you toss a ball straight up in the air, you notice it accelerates more slowly as it reaches its peak height until it is momentarily motionless
at its peak, at  which point, it depends slowly and then more quicly due to gravity. 

# Is there a force acting on the ball when you toss it straight up in the air?

## Why does a dropped ball fall downward?

The ball is pulled downward by its weight and it accelerates downward in response to the force. The weight of the object, that is, the force 
exerted on the object when it's falling downward, is proportional to its **mass**, that is, the object's resistance to being accelerated. The 
mass of an object can be thought of as the difficulty that it takes to make the object change velocity. The weight near Earth's surface is 
9.8 newtons per kilogram of mass (<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=weight&space;=&space;9.8&space;\frac{N}{kg}&space;*&space;mass" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?weight&space;=&space;9.8&space;\frac{N}{kg}&space;*&space;mass" title="weight = 9.8 \frac{N}{kg} * mass" /></a>)
This is known as **acceleration due to gravity** and is commonly represented by a lowercase g.

## How differently do different balls fall?

All balls fall at the same rate. A sheet of paper appears to fall more slowly because of air resistence. 

A bowling ball and a baseball fall and land at the same time. Why? The bowling ball has more weight, more force beight exerted by gravity, and 
more mass, more resistence to acceleration. Because both mass and weight are proportional. These two quantities cancel so that the balls hit 
the ground at the same time.

Suppose you are carrying an object as you walk forward at a constant velocity. You are more aware of the object's weight because you must support 
the weight of the object. Since you are moving at a constant velocity, you are unaware of the object's mass because you don't need to accelerate the object.


## How would a ball fall on the moon?

The ball would fall more slowly because the moon has less gravity than the Earth.

The strength of gravity is slightly different on different parts of the earth. On a mountain, you would actually weight less because gravity  
is slightly weaker

An object labeled with a weight of 1lb and a mass of 400g will be labeled incorrectly if taken to the moon. The mass will remain the same (400g) 
but the weight will only be about 17% because the moon's gravity is weaker.

**Mass is universal** weight depends on the strength of the local gravity.


## How does a falling ball move after it's dropped?

Its velocity increases steadily in the downward direction, but its position increases with each passing second.

If you dropped a ball in zero gravity, the ball would remain because it remains inertial. If dropped the same ball in zero gravity, but gave it a push in the downward direction, the ball would fall at a constant velocity because there is no acceleration accting on the ball.

Calculating the average velocity of an object is difficult but a special case exists when the ball is dropped from rest because we can take the average between the starting and final velocity.

## How can a ball move upward and still be falling?

A falling ball is acceleration downward reguardless of its current velocity. Even if you were to throw an object straight up in the air, its still accelerating in the downward direction with the acceleration due to gravity. At the object's peak height, it's velocity is zero but it's acceleration is still the acceleration due to gravity. When you're throwing the object in the air, it's velocities at the start and finish will be the same so that there is a nice symetry on the graph.

![Throwing ball upwards](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d373e0e28ec5a43a2afac3098348c56a)

The ball moves upward not because of any force but because the ball's inertia is letting it coast freely in motion according to Newton's first law. The ball is still experiencing only one force: its weight, which is directed downward. It is moving upward not because something is pushing it upward, but because of inertia. In the absence of any force, the ball would coast upward because of inertia. Because of its weight, the ball can't maintain its constant upward velocity, but it takes time for the ball to stop moving upward.
## How does a ball's horizontal motion affect its fall?

The ball's horizontal coasting motion has no effect on its vertical falling motion. The ball's horizontal motion is only subject to air resistence and friction.

If you were to roll two balls off of a table, one with less mass and one with more mass, they would still hit the floor at the same time even though the horizontal component of motion would be different. Once they leave the table, both balls are falling. They start their falls with zero component of velocity in the vertical directionâ€”they are neither rising nor descending. The vertical component of their motion is that of a ball falling from rest and they fall together and hit the ground at the same time. They have different components of velocity in the downfield direction, however, so the faster moving orange ball travels farther downfield during its travels and hits the ground farther from the table than does the black ball.

# Quiz

1. Question 1
Which force is your weight? [The force that is your weight and not a force that is equal to your weight.]

The force that causes you to accelerate downward when you are high above the surface of a trampoline.


2. Question 2
You visit a bowling alley and examine the bowling balls that are available for use. They all look identical, but some are heavier (have greater weights) than others. How can you identify the heaviest ball? [Neglect any effects due to air]

Hold each ball motionless in your hand and choose the one that requires the largest upward force to keep it from falling.

3. Question 3
You are traveling on an intergalactic cruise spaceship in deep, gravity-free space. You find that the ship has a bowling alley! Once again, there are many identical-looking balls available for use. Without gravity, however, they all have the same weight: zero.

While still on the spaceship in deep, gravity-free space, how can you identify the ball that will be heaviest when your cruise ship lands on a planet and gravity is present? [Neglect any effects due to air]

Shake each ball rapidly back and forth, and choose the ball that accelerates the least in response to the same force as on Earth.


4. Question 4
You've learned to juggle 4 balls at once here on Earth. During a visit to the moon, where the acceleration due to gravity is about 1/6th its Earth value, you decide to try juggling those same 4 balls. You find that, on the moon, each ball has ________________.

less weight and falls more slowly than on Earth. It undergoes the same acceleration as on Earth when exposed to the same force as on Earth.


5. Question 5
While vacationing on a tropical island, you find the courage to step off a high cliff and fall for 4 seconds before entering the water below. Exactly 2 seconds into your fall, you glance at the cliff face and see a secret treasure embedded in the rock. When you recover from your plunge, you return to the cliff top and find that treasure ______________________.

1/4 the distance down from the cliff top to the water.

7. Question 7
You throw a handful of different coins up and forward and watch them arc through space. They leave your hand at the same moment and with the same starting velocity. Neglecting any effects due to air, where and when do those coins hit the level ground in front of your feet? [Note: air can significantly affect fast-moving coins. If you want to test your answer experimentally, be careful to minimize those air effects. Also, be safe!]

All the coins hit the ground at the same time, but the heavier coins hit the ground farther from your feet than do the lighter coins.

8. Question 8
You throw a priceless porcelain vase straight up and watch as it rises to peak height and then drops safely back into your hands. Fortunately, the vase's owner wasn't watching. What were the vase's velocity and acceleration at the moment it reached peak height? [Do not test your answer experimentally, unless you take full responsibility for any consequences!]

The vase's velocity was zero. The vase's acceleration was the acceleration due to gravity, which is not zero.

9. Question 9
When an archer sends an arrow toward a target, the archer must aim the arrow above the target's bullseye (its center) in order for the arrow to hit that bullseye. If the archer uses a stronger bow and therefore a faster-moving arrow, how will that change how the archer aims the arrow in order to hit the same target's bullseye? [Neglect any effects due to air]

The archer must still aim above the target's bullseye, but less far above the bullseye than with the slower-moving arrow.

10. Question 10
As you collect plastic bottles for recycling, one of the bottles rolls horizontally off the kitchen counter and bounces on the floor about 1 foot (0.3 meters) outward from the base of the counter. Why didn't the bottle drop straight down and hit the floor exactly at the base of the counter?

The bottle coasted horizontally outward as it fell vertically.
