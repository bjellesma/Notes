**Weight** is the force exerted on an object by the gravity.

If you toss a ball straight up in the air, you notice it accelerates more slowly as it reaches its peak height until it is momentarily motionless
at its peak, at  which point, it depends slowly and then more quicly due to gravity. 

# Is there a force acting on the ball when you toss it straight up in the air?

## Why does a dropped ball fall downward?

The ball is pulled downward by its weight and it accelerates downward in response to the force. The weight of the object, that is, the force 
exerted on the object when it's falling downward, is proportional to its **mass**, that is, the object's resistance to being accelerated. The 
mass of an object can be thought of as the difficulty that it takes to make the object change velocity. The weight near Earth's surface is 
9.8 newtons per kilogram of mass (<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=weight&space;=&space;9.8&space;\frac{N}{kg}&space;*&space;mass" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?weight&space;=&space;9.8&space;\frac{N}{kg}&space;*&space;mass" title="weight = 9.8 \frac{N}{kg} * mass" /></a>)
This is known as **acceleration due to gravity** and is commonly represented by a lowercase g.

## How differently do different balls fall?

All balls fall at the same rate. A sheet of paper appears to fall more slowly because of air resistence. 

A bowling ball and a baseball fall and land at the same time. Why? The bowling ball has more weight, more force beight exerted by gravity, and 
more mass, more resistence to acceleration. Because both mass and weight are proportional. These two quantities cancel so that the balls hit 
the ground at the same time.

Suppose you are carrying an object as you walk forward at a constant velocity. You are more aware of the object's weight because you must support 
the weight of the object. Since you are moving at a constant velocity, you are unaware of the object's mass because you don't need to accelerate the object.


## How would a ball fall on the moon?

The ball would fall more slowly because the moon has less gravity than the Earth.

The strength of gravity is slightly different on different parts of the earth. On a mountain, you would actually weight less because gravity  
is slightly weaker

An object labeled with a weight of 1lb and a mass of 400g will be labeled incorrectly if taken to the moon. The mass will remain the same (400g) 
but the weight will only be about 17% because the moon's gravity is weaker.

**Mass is universal** weight depends on the strength of the local gravity.


## How does a falling ball move after it's dropped?

Its velocity increases steadily in the downward direction, but its position increases with each passing second.

If you dropped a ball in zero gravity, the ball would remain because it remains inertial. If dropped the same ball in zero gravity, but gave it a push in the downward direction, the ball would fall at a constant velocity because there is no acceleration accting on the ball.

Calculating the average velocity of an object is difficult but a special case exists when the ball is dropped from rest because we can take the average between the starting and final velocity.

## How can a ball move upward and still be falling?

A falling ball is acceleration downward reguardless of its current velocity. Even if you were to throw an object straight up in the air, its still accelerating in the downward direction with the acceleration due to gravity. At the object's peak height, it's velocity is zero but it's acceleration is still the acceleration due to gravity. When you're throwing the object in the air, it's velocities at the start and finish will be the same so that there is a nice symetry on the graph.

The ball moves upward not because of any force but because the ball's inertia is letting it coast freely in motion according to Newton's first law. The ball is still experiencing only one force: its weight, which is directed downward. It is moving upward not because something is pushing it upward, but because of inertia. In the absence of any force, the ball would coast upward because of inertia. Because of its weight, the ball can't maintain its constant upward velocity, but it takes time for the ball to stop moving upward.
## How does a ball's horizontal motion affect its fall?

The ball's horizontal coasting motion has no effect on its vertical falling motion. The ball's horizontal motion is only subject to air resistence and friction.

If you were to roll two balls off of a table, one with less mass and one with more mass, they would still hit the floor at the same time even though the horizontal component of motion would be different. Once they leave the table, both balls are falling. They start their falls with zero component of velocity in the vertical directionâ€”they are neither rising nor descending. The vertical component of their motion is that of a ball falling from rest and they fall together and hit the ground at the same time. They have different components of velocity in the downfield direction, however, so the faster moving orange ball travels farther downfield during its travels and hits the ground farther from the table than does the black ball.
