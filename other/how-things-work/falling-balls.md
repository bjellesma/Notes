**Weight** is the force exerted on an object by the gravity.

If you toss a ball straight up in the air, you notice it accelerates more slowly as it reaches its peak height until it is momentarily motionless
at its peak, at  which point, it depends slowly and then more quicly due to gravity. 

# Is there a force acting on the ball when you toss it straight up in the air?

## Why does a dropped ball fall downward?

The ball is pulled downward by its weight and it accelerates downward in response to the force. The weight of the object, that is, the force 
exerted on the object when it's falling downward, is proportional to its **mass**, that is, the object's resistance to being accelerated. The 
mass of an object can be thought of as the difficulty that it takes to make the object change velocity. The weight near Earth's surface is 
9.8 newtons per kilogram of mass (<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=weight&space;=&space;9.8&space;\frac{N}{kg}&space;*&space;mass" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?weight&space;=&space;9.8&space;\frac{N}{kg}&space;*&space;mass" title="weight = 9.8 \frac{N}{kg} * mass" /></a>)
This is known as **acceleration due to gravity** and is commonly represented by a lowercase g.

## How differently do different balls fall?

All balls fall at the same rate. A sheet of paper appears to fall more slowly because of air resistence. 

A bowling ball and a baseball fall and land at the same time. Why? The bowling ball has more weight, more force beight exerted by gravity, and 
more mass, more resistence to acceleration. Because both mass and weight are proportional. These two quantities cancel so that the balls hit 
the ground at the same time.

Suppose you are carrying an object as you walk forward at a constant velocity. You are more aware of the object's weight because you must support 
the weight of the object. Since you are moving at a constant velocity, you are unaware of the object's mass because you don't need to accelerate the object.


## How would a ball fall on the moon?

The ball would fall more slowly because the moon has less gravity than the Earth.

The strength of gravity is slightly different on different parts of the earth. On a mountain, you would actually weight less because gravity  
is slightly weaker

An object labeled with a weight of 1lb and a mass of 400g will be labeled incorrectly if taken to the moon. The mass will remain the same (400g) 
but the weight will only be about 17% because the moon's gravity is weaker.

**Mass is universal** weight depends on the strength of the local gravity.


## How does a falling ball move after it's dropped?

## How can a ball move upward and still be falling?

## How does a ball's horizontal motion affect its fall?
