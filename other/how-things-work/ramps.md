# Why doesn't a wagon fall through a sidewalk?

The sidewalk pushes up on the wagon to prevent the two objects from occupying the same space at the same time. The sidewalk exerts 
a support force on the wagon. A **Support Force** is a force acting to prevent two surfaces from occupying the same spadce at the 
same time and exerted pperpendicular to those surfaces.

In summary, the support force of the sidewalk acts upward to cancel out the downward weight of the wagon. Keep in mind that the direction 
of the support force is upward because it is **perpendicular** to the force causing that reaction. Support Forces bring up **Newton's 
Third Law of Motion** - For every force that one object exerts on a second object, there is an equal but oppositely directed force that 
the second object exerts on the first object

Because of Newton's third law, there must be an even number of forces.

# Why does the sidewalk perfectly support the wagon's weight?

# How does a wagon move as you let it roll freely on a ramp?

# Why is it more exhausting to lift a wagon up than to lower it down?

# Why is it easier to pull a wagon uphill on a ramp than to lift it up a ladder?

# When does an object on a ramp have the most energy?
