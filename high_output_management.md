The **limiting step** is the part of production that will take the most time
**process manufacturing** is an activity that pysically or chemically changes the material
**assembly** is the part of the process where components are put togeter
**test** subjects the components to the total examination of its characteristics
For example, training a sales force follows the above three operations. Coversion of large amounts of data to sales strategies is the process manufacturing. combination of various sales strategies into a coherent program is the assembly. test comes in the form of a "dry run" pitch.
a common rule of thumb should be to try to detect and fix problems at the lowest value stage possible
Every adminstrative team of an org as a **work output indicator**. For example, for a sales team, this would be the number of sales orders entered.
there is a difference between businesses that are **build to order** and **build to forcast**. If you order something custom made like a car, the plant will operate as build to order for that specific request so it will take a long time. Conversely, companis like Intel are build to forcast and they build an amount based on anticipation in a market.
the concept of **leverage** is the output of a work activity. For example, a waiter able to jugle boiling two eggs and operating two toasters has higher leverage than the employee that can only do one at a time.
one way to increase an employee's leverage is through invoking automation in a process called **work simplification**
to achieve automation, you should list out each step on paper and then, before trying to automate, question why you need each step.
Grove actually recommends to go to the area of the company to express a two minute concern with a subordinate. An office visit is more likely to take thirty minutes to express a two minute concern.
**Managerial Meddling** or micromanaging is when you dictate to the employee the exact steps and this can be an example of negative leverage.
the thought is that with managerial meddling, the subordinate will begin to feel more restricted and show less initiative.
It's a good idea to have focus time once and awhile and have an automated message or status tell users that a certain employee is busy and won't be available for this time unless it is urgent.
