* The **limiting step** is the part of production that will take the most time
**process manufacturing** is an activity that pysically or chemically changes the material
**assembly** is the part of the process where components are put togeter
**test** subjects the components to the total examination of its characteristics
For example, training a sales force follows the above three operations. Coversion of large amounts of data to sales strategies is the process manufacturing. combination of various sales strategies into a coherent program is the assembly. test comes in the form of a "dry run" pitch.
a common rule of thumb should be to try to detect and fix problems at the lowest value stage possible
Every adminstrative team of an org as a **work output indicator**. For example, for a sales team, this would be the number of sales orders entered.
there is a difference between businesses that are **build to order** and **build to forcast**. If you order something custom made like a car, the plant will operate as build to order for that specific request so it will take a long time. Conversely, companis like Intel are build to forcast and they build an amount based on anticipation in a market.
the concept of **leverage** is the output of a work activity. For example, a waiter able to jugle boiling two eggs and operating two toasters has higher leverage than the employee that can only do one at a time.
one way to increase an employee's leverage is through invoking automation in a process called **work simplification**
to achieve automation, you should list out each step on paper and then, before trying to automate, question why you need each step.
Grove actually recommends to go to the area of the company to express a two minute concern with a subordinate. An office visit is more likely to take thirty minutes to express a two minute concern.
**Managerial Meddling** or micromanaging is when you dictate to the employee the exact steps and this can be an example of negative leverage.
the thought is that with managerial meddling, the subordinate will begin to feel more restricted and show less initiative.
It's a good idea to have focus time once and awhile and have an automated message or status tell users that a certain employee is busy and won't be available for this time unless it is urgent.
* The best that a manager can hope for is to create an environment in which a motivated employee can florish. This is because an employee will either fail a task because of incompetance or motivation. While incompetance can be fixed with additional training, motivation is something that must come from within. However, an attitude may consistute an indicator but it is not a metric like performance.
* For some people, money becomes a measure of success, which motivates them to keep achieving. For others, once they make enough money, they are no longer motivated by that so we must find some other source of movivation
* Fear of loss of job can only motivate people so far. Eventually people will start to do the bare minimum in order to not face loss of job
* Once a persons motivation gets to be self actualizing on Maslow's hierarchy, it will be self sustaining and limitless because the person will constantly try to achieve higher and higher. at the lower levels of physiology and safety, a person will acjhieve enough so that they can live a comfortable life, social need can only take you so far as to fit in, and esteem can be a limit because once you've achieved a goal, you can start to lose motivation. ![image](https://github.com/bjellesma/Notes/assets/7660667/803833ec-b72f-43e0-a069-3fe4ef2ba9bf)
* a manager should be like a coach. they take no personal credit for themselves, they are hard on their teammates to get the best performance, and the coach was once or is currently, a player in the game so they understand the game well.
* The age old question of whether or not a supervisor should have a friendship with an employee is different for everyone. On the one hand, friendships have been destroyed becaused a supervisor had to discipline a subordinate, on the other hand, a supervisor disciplined a subordinate and the subordinate respected the supervisor because he knew that the supervisor was looking out for the proffesional interests of the the subordinate.
* When giving a review, it's important to only focus on a few items or else you risk the subordinate having sensory overload and not remembering everything. If there are seven items that you, as the manager want to focus on in this review, you should limit this instead to the four more important ones.
