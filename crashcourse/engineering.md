Engineer started with **military engineering** which was used to build weapons
**civil engineering** was named as such because it involved engineering civilian things like bridges
**mechanical engineering** refers to building machines to solve problems
**electrical engineering** cam about in the 19th century and deals with electronics
**chemical engineering** studies chemicals making up foods and medicine
Though there are other branches of engineering, the above are seen as the four main branches of engineering and are classified under **industrial engineering**


## Civil Engineering

Imohtep was the chief of works in Egypt and oversaw the building of the Pyramids. He was seen as the first Civil Engineer.
**structural engineering** and **construction engineering** are both joined under Civil Engineering.

An important example of Civil engineering is city planning.

## Mechanical Engineering

The field of engineering that focuses on the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of machines.

The wheel is one of the oldest examples of mechanical engineering

The steam engineer, invented in the 18th century, is another big example because it revolutionized transportation.

**Biomechanics** is one of the newest fields of mechanical engineering and is used to create devices, such as the exoskeleton suit, to combine with our biology to extend human capabilities.

## Electrical Engineering

There are three main branches of electrical engineering today

### Telecomunications

### Power and Lighting

Edison was all for **Direct Current (DC)** while Tesla and Westinghouse were all for **Alternating Current (AC)**

### Computer Engineering

The **Transistor** was a semiconductor device that could amplify or switch electrical signals.

## Chemical Engineering

One of the broadest of the engineering fields, focused not only on chemicals but also on developing and designing plants and processes for manufacturing chemicals.

**Biomedical Engineering** typically refers to healthcare in that you're engineering medicine and prostetics.
**Industrial Engineering** refers to the optimization of the assembly line and is the backbone of most engineering.
