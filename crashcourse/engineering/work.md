When a ball expands, we call this **negative work** because work is being done by the ball. Conversly, when we squeeze a ball, we call this ***positive work** because work is being done on the ball.

A Piston is pushed down by a crank shaft to compress gas and cause a spark. The piston is then let up to let the gas expand.

*Reversibily** in engineering is the idea that you can return a system to its original state without doing any adittional work. Reversibility is imposible to acheive in the real world because of themodynamics. But the ratio of a system's irreversibility to reversibility to known as **efficiency**. A 100% efficient system is fully reversible.
