**Thermodynamics** is the branch of physics and engineering that focuses on converting energy, often in the form of heat and work. It describes how thermal energy is converted to and from other forms of energy and also to work.

When chemical reactions take place, some energy is often released as thermal energy.

An **equilibrium** is where certain properties like pressure, volume, or temperature, remain the same across the system. An example of something reaching equilibrium is when you leave a soda out in the sun too long and the soda heats to air temperature.

**Zeroth law of thermodynamics** – If two thermodynamic systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

**First law of thermodynamics** – Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only change forms.

The higher that you climb a ladder, the more **Gravitational Potential Energy** that you have, that is, stored energy the higher that you are.
