# Macronutriant Structure

In order to survive, we need food, water, and air. We can survive about 3 minutes without air, 3 days without water, and 3 weeks without food. 

In 1897, a physician named William Proudt first proposed we need three macronutrients: 

**Carbohydrates** come in simple and complex varients. These provide 4 calories per gram.

**Simple Carbohydrates** include **monosaturides** (single sugar molecule) like Glucose and Fructose and **disaturides** (two sugar molecules) like Sucrose.

**Complex Carbohydrates** include **polysaturides** like **Starch** and **Dietary Fiber**

During digestion, glucose can be broken down into energy in the form of **ATP** while it can also be stored as **Adipose Tissue**

**Protein** can be broken down into chains of **Amino Acids** during digestion which can be used to repair tissue. Amino Acids can also be used for energy as ATP or be stored as Adipose tissue. Provide 4 calories per gram.

**Fats** have a glycerol backbone and can be broken down into ATP or be stored as Adipose Tissue. Fats are the most energy dense providing 9 calories per gram. Fats can be divided into Saturated and Unsaturated Fats. **Saturated Fats** are fats that are saturated with hydrogen molecules like cheese and butter so that they can appear solid at room temperature. **Unsaturated Fats** like olive oil have too many kinks in their molecule structure to be saturated with hydrogen molecules and therefore liquid at room tempeture. **Omega 3 Fatty Acids** are a special type of unsaturated fat and contained in nuts, flax seed, and vegetable oils. Omega 3s are the only fatty acid that we can't produce so we need this. Manmade unsaturated fat tend to have an unstable molecular structure that can flip, which is where we get the name **trans fat**. Trans fats tend to increase the risk of artery plaque which can lead to heart disease. When it comes to fat, the general advice is to enjoy unsaturated fat like avacado, reduce intake of satured fat like red meat, and avoid trans fat like french fries. Trans fats tend to lower HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) while raising LDL (bad cholesterol). Saturated fat raise LDL but haven't been shown to reduce HDL as significantly.

Favoring energy expenditure over energy storage is one of the goals of people trying to lose weight.

Alcohol provides 7 calories per gram

The **glycemic index** is a measure of how long it takes for injested glucose to be released into the blood stream. Whole grains like brown rice result in a slower release of glucose and a lower glycemic index. Complex carbs like white bread and soda release glucose fast. The faster release of glucose results in **unstable blood sugar** and an earlier return to hunger and a tendency to overeat. For losing weight, choosing foods lower on the glycemic index are key.

Animal Based proteins like eggs and fish are a **complete protein** providing all types of needed amino acid whereas plant based protein like lentils are an **incomplete protein** that only provide some of the amino acids we need. However, foods like rice and lentils are based on the idea of combining protein to provide a complete protein. Therefore, having plant based protein a few times a week is benificial because meals based on animal based protein often contain more fat and saturated fats. We need 20 amino acids.

Processed Meats ecspecially often contain nitrates which can lead to damaging blood vessels. These also often contain a high sodium content which can lead to high blood pressure.
