Quantities of food can be an issue. Proportions of food are larger than they used to be. 

1. Ideally, a smaller dinnner plate should be made up of 1/2 vegetables/plant based proteins, 1/4 lean protein, and 1/4 whole grain.
2. Drinking water before and after a meal has been shown to also help with weight management.

# Navigating the supermarket

You don't need to shop at a farmer's market to eat healthy. Generally, the less processed foods appear around the perimeter of the store. The less ingredients that food has is often an indication that there's less processing in the food. This means that foods with no ingredient lists like fruits and veggies are often the best choices.

# Reading Nutrition Labels

1. The best strategy is to avoid foods that have nutrition labels because these foods are going to be packaged and processed. Fresh fruits and veggies won't have nutrition labels. However, it's pretty unavoidable to have some packaged foods. 
2. It's important to keep in mind the number of servings that a food can have because an item that looks like a single serving will often have more than 1 serving listed with it. This is a multiplier for any nutritional facts.
3. **Dietary Fiber** is important to look at as well as it's important for:
    * Maintain Gastrointestinal health
    * Stabilize blood gucose
    * Delay hunger from returning
4. 4 teaspoons of sugar is in 1 gram so a soft drink containing 24 grams of sugar will contain 6 teaspoons
5. In general, the fats found in processed food is less healthy than the fats found in plant based foods such as avocodos or nuts. **Polyunsaturated** and **Monounsaturated** Fats are fine. **Saturated** fats, such as found in red meat or butter, should be consumed in moderation, and **Trans Fats** should be avoided.
6. Sodium is usually used to help keep foods from spoiling so sodium should also not be consumed in excess.
7. Vitamins on a nutrition label can be misleading because an excess of vitamins is really not needed an this can be a marketting tactic to sell more product.

# Moderation

You shouldn't eat until you're full, you should eat until you're not hungry anymore. The american food system is usually an all or nothing approach. Different cultures have different approaches to eating. Chinese and French eat until they're about 80% full whereas Americans tend to eat until they're 100% full.

The reason other cultures are typically better about food is that they eat slower, eat a more enjoyable experience, and eat socially with others. This leads to other cultures enjoying their foods more.
