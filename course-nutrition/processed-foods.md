# Processing Foods

Processed foods has a longer shelf life and is resistant to pests because pests are less attracted to food that has less nutrients in it. Foods that are more processed and have less nutrients will spoil more slowly than foods are homemade and have a higher amount of nutrients.

Foods like soda are considered **energy dense** because it has a high number of calories. Foods like fresh spinach are less energy dense but more **nutrient dense** because although it has a low number of calories, it has a high amount of nutrients. nutrient density is nutritional value divided by number of calories (energy)

**Metabolic Syndrome** is characterized by the following: increased blood pressure (hypertension), increased fasting plasma glucose (hyperglycemia), high serum triglycerides (hyperlipidemia), and low HDL levels.

On a normal 2000 cal/day diet, it's recommended that 5%, 100 calories, comes from sugar. This is 6tsp. a serving of natural oatmeal can have about 4tsp so most people get that amount from breakfast alone. Sugar needs to be reduced but we need to be careful to not replace this with something like animal proteins, which can also not be very good for us.

**intrinsic sugar** comes from food like fruits and is generally not associated with bad sugar. **free sugar** are additives added to food like soda and processed foods to make them taste and sell better.

Home cooked food is generally better (regardless of the food) because the process is a lot cleaner. The issue that comes from this is that people have four complaints when it comes to home cooking. All of which have solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Time | Prepare ahead |
| Energy | Share the work |
| Skill | Improve over time |
| Money | Do the best with the resources |

People are told that cooking is boring and time consuming which is why they'll go out to eat.

It's important to take a stepwise approach and gradually improve your diet rather than make a dramatic rapid change. a rapid approach could be overwhelming and cause you not to stick with it.
