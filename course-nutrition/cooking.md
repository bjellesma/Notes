# Cooking

People try to simplify cooking but the human diet is very complex.

Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. These seven words are a helpful mantra for anyone trying to take control of their health. The key emphasis to eat real food and not fake processed food.

## Fundamental Ingrediants

Cooking can take a lot of ingrediants so it's useful to have the basics on hand to last at least until the next shopping trip. This can include olive oil, onions, lemon, etc.

## Vegatables and fruits

The average american consumes less than 2 cups of fruits and vegetables per day. Chopping onions is probably the easiest way to achieve this. Organic is not as important as simply eating fruits and veggies. **organic** just means that the fruits and veggies don't have pesticides.

## Sensible Substitutes

Our bodies will find ways to make up for a perceived deprevation of food so skipping meals is not a good idea to maintain a healthy weight. For example, instead on snacking on junk food in the evenings, you could snack on humas and dip. Homemade versions of almost anything is better because it won't have the preservatives.
